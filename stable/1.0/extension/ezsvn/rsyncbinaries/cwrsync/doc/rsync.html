<H2>NAME</H2>rsync - faster, flexible replacement for rcp

<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>rsync is a program that behaves in much the same way that rcp does, but has 
many more options and uses the rsync remote-update protocol to greatly speed up 
file transfers when the destination file is being updated. 
<P>The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the 
differences between two sets of files across the network connection, using an 
efficient checksum-search algorithm described in the technical report that 
accompanies this package. 
<P>Some of the additional features of rsync are: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>support for copying links, devices, owners, groups, and permissions 
  <LI>exclude and exclude-from options similar to GNU tar 
  <LI>a CVS exclude mode for ignoring the same files that CVS would ignore 
  <LI>can use any transparent remote shell, including ssh or rsh 
  <LI>does not require super-user privileges 
  <LI>pipelining of file transfers to minimize latency costs 
  <LI>support for anonymous or authenticated rsync daemons (ideal for mirroring) 
  </LI></UL>
<P>
<H2>GENERAL</H2>
<P>Rsync copies files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the current 
host (it does not support copying files between two remote hosts). 
<P>There are two different ways for rsync to contact a remote system: using a 
remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or rsh) or contacting an 
rsync daemon directly via TCP. The remote-shell transport is used whenever the 
source or destination path contains a single colon (:) separator after a host 
specification. Contacting an rsync daemon directly happens when the source or 
destination path contains a double colon (::) separator after a host 
specification, OR when an rsync:// URL is specified (see also the "USING 
RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION" section for an exception to 
this latter rule). 
<P>As a special case, if a single source arg is specified without a destination, 
the files are listed in an output format similar to "ls -l". 
<P>As expected, if neither the source or destination path specify a remote host, 
the copy occurs locally (see also the <STRONG>--list-only</STRONG> option). 
<P>
<H2>SETUP</H2>
<P>See the file README for installation instructions. 
<P>Once installed, you can use rsync to any machine that you can access via a 
remote shell (as well as some that you can access using the rsync daemon-mode 
protocol). For remote transfers, a modern rsync uses ssh for its communications, 
but it may have been configured to use a different remote shell by default, such 
as rsh or remsh. 
<P>You can also specify any remote shell you like, either by using the 
<STRONG>-e</STRONG> command line option, or by setting the RSYNC_RSH environment 
variable. 
<P>Note that rsync must be installed on both the source and destination 
machines. 
<P>
<H2>USAGE</H2>
<P>You use rsync in the same way you use rcp. You must specify a source and a 
destination, one of which may be remote. 
<P>Perhaps the best way to explain the syntax is with some examples: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -t *.c foo:src/</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This would transfer all files matching the pattern *.c from the current 
directory to the directory src on the machine foo. If any of the files already 
exist on the remote system then the rsync remote-update protocol is used to 
update the file by sending only the differences. See the tech report for 
details. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -avz foo:src/bar /data/tmp</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This would recursively transfer all files from the directory src/bar on the 
machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar directory on the local machine. The files are 
transferred in "archive" mode, which ensures that symbolic links, devices, 
attributes, permissions, ownerships, etc. are preserved in the transfer. 
Additionally, compression will be used to reduce the size of data portions of 
the transfer. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -avz foo:src/bar/ /data/tmp</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to avoid creating an 
additional directory level at the destination. You can think of a trailing / on 
a source as meaning "copy the contents of this directory" as opposed to "copy 
the directory by name", but in both cases the attributes of the containing 
directory are transferred to the containing directory on the destination. In 
other words, each of the following commands copies the files in the same way, 
including their setting of the attributes of /dest/foo: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -av /src/foo /dest</CODE><BR><CODE>rsync -av /src/foo/ 
  /dest/foo</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note also that host and module references don't require a trailing slash to 
copy the contents of the default directory. For example, both of these copy the 
remote directory's contents into "/dest": 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -av host: /dest</CODE><BR><CODE>rsync -av host::module 
  /dest</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can also use rsync in local-only mode, where both the source and 
destination don't have a ':' in the name. In this case it behaves like an 
improved copy command. 
<P>Finally, you can list all the (listable) modules available from a particular 
rsync daemon by leaving off the module name: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync somehost.mydomain.com::</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>See the following section for more details. 
<P>
<H2>ADVANCED USAGE</H2>
<P>The syntax for requesting multiple files from a remote host involves using 
quoted spaces in the SRC. Some examples: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync host::'modname/dir1/file1 modname/dir2/file2' 
  /dest</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This would copy file1 and file2 into /dest from an rsync daemon. Each 
additional arg must include the same "modname/" prefix as the first one, and 
must be preceded by a single space. All other spaces are assumed to be a part of 
the filenames. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -av host:'dir1/file1 dir2/file2' 
/dest</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This would copy file1 and file2 into /dest using a remote shell. This 
word-splitting is done by the remote shell, so if it doesn't work it means that 
the remote shell isn't configured to split its args based on whitespace (a very 
rare setting, but not unknown). If you need to transfer a filename that contains 
whitespace, you'll need to either escape the whitespace in a way that the remote 
shell will understand, or use wildcards in place of the spaces. Two examples of 
this are: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -av host:'file\ name\ with\ spaces' 
  /dest</CODE><BR><CODE>rsync -av host:file?name?with?spaces 
/dest</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This latter example assumes that your shell passes through unmatched 
wildcards. If it complains about "no match", put the name in quotes. 
<P>
<H2>CONNECTING TO AN RSYNC DAEMON</H2>
<P>It is also possible to use rsync without a remote shell as the transport. In 
this case you will directly connect to a remote rsync daemon, typically using 
TCP port 873. (This obviously requires the daemon to be running on the remote 
system, so refer to the STARTING AN RSYNC DAEMON TO ACCEPT CONNECTIONS section 
below for information on that.) 
<P>Using rsync in this way is the same as using it with a remote shell except 
that: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>you either use a double colon :: instead of a single colon to separate the 
  hostname from the path, or you use an rsync:// URL. 
  <LI>the first word of the "path" is actually a module name. 
  <LI>the remote daemon may print a message of the day when you connect. 
  <LI>if you specify no path name on the remote daemon then the list of 
  accessible paths on the daemon will be shown. 
  <LI>if you specify no local destination then a listing of the specified files 
  on the remote daemon is provided. 
  <LI>you must not specify the <STRONG>--rsh</STRONG> (<STRONG>-e</STRONG>) 
  option. </LI></UL>
<P>An example that copies all the files in a remote module named "src": 
<P><PRE>    rsync -av host::src /dest
</PRE>
<P>Some modules on the remote daemon may require authentication. If so, you will 
receive a password prompt when you connect. You can avoid the password prompt by 
setting the environment variable RSYNC_PASSWORD to the password you want to use 
or using the <STRONG>--password-file</STRONG> option. This may be useful when 
scripting rsync. 
<P>WARNING: On some systems environment variables are visible to all users. On 
those systems using <STRONG>--password-file</STRONG> is recommended. 
<P>You may establish the connection via a web proxy by setting the environment 
variable RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port pair pointing to your web proxy. Note 
that your web proxy's configuration must support proxy connections to port 873. 
<P>
<H2>USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION</H2>
<P>It is sometimes useful to use various features of an rsync daemon (such as 
named modules) without actually allowing any new socket connections into a 
system (other than what is already required to allow remote-shell access). Rsync 
supports connecting to a host using a remote shell and then spawning a 
single-use "daemon" server that expects to read its config file in the home dir 
of the remote user. This can be useful if you want to encrypt a daemon-style 
transfer's data, but since the daemon is started up fresh by the remote user, 
you may not be able to use features such as chroot or change the uid used by the 
daemon. (For another way to encrypt a daemon transfer, consider using ssh to 
tunnel a local port to a remote machine and configure a normal rsync daemon on 
that remote host to only allow connections from "localhost".) 
<P>From the user's perspective, a daemon transfer via a remote-shell connection 
uses nearly the same command-line syntax as a normal rsync-daemon transfer, with 
the only exception being that you must explicitly set the remote shell program 
on the command-line with the <STRONG>--rsh=COMMAND</STRONG> option. (Setting the 
RSYNC_RSH in the environment will not turn on this functionality.) For example: 
<P><PRE>    rsync -av --rsh=ssh host::module /dest
</PRE>
<P>If you need to specify a different remote-shell user, keep in mind that the 
user@ prefix in front of the host is specifying the rsync-user value (for a 
module that requires user-based authentication). This means that you must give 
the '-l user' option to ssh when specifying the remote-shell, as in this example 
that uses the short version of the <STRONG>--rsh</STRONG> option: 
<P><PRE>    rsync -av -e "ssh -l ssh-user" rsync-user@host::module /dest
</PRE>
<P>The "ssh-user" will be used at the ssh level; the "rsync-user" will be used 
to log-in to the "module". 
<P>
<H2>STARTING AN RSYNC DAEMON TO ACCEPT CONNECTIONS</H2>
<P>In order to connect to an rsync daemon, the remote system needs to have a 
daemon already running (or it needs to have configured something like inetd to 
spawn an rsync daemon for incoming connections on a particular port). For full 
information on how to start a daemon that will handling incoming socket 
connections, see the <STRONG>rsyncd.conf</STRONG>(5) man page -- that is the 
config file for the daemon, and it contains the full details for how to run the 
daemon (including stand-alone and inetd configurations). 
<P>If you're using one of the remote-shell transports for the transfer, there is 
no need to manually start an rsync daemon. 
<P>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>
<P>Here are some examples of how I use rsync. 
<P>To backup my wife's home directory, which consists of large MS Word files and 
mail folders, I use a cron job that runs 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -Cavz . arvidsjaur:backup</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>each night over a PPP connection to a duplicate directory on my machine 
"arvidsjaur". 
<P>To synchronize my samba source trees I use the following Makefile targets: 
<P><PRE>    get:
            rsync -avuzb --exclude '*~' samba:samba/ .
    put:
            rsync -Cavuzb . samba:samba/
    sync: get put
</PRE>
<P>this allows me to sync with a CVS directory at the other end of the 
connection. I then do CVS operations on the remote machine, which saves a lot of 
time as the remote CVS protocol isn't very efficient. 
<P>I mirror a directory between my "old" and "new" ftp sites with the command: 
<P><CODE>rsync -az -e ssh --delete ~ftp/pub/samba 
nimbus:"~ftp/pub/tridge"</CODE> 
<P>This is launched from cron every few hours.

<P>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
<P>rsync uses the GNU long options package. Many of the command line options 
have two variants, one short and one long. These are shown below, separated by 
commas. Some options only have a long variant. The '=' for options that take a 
parameter is optional; whitespace can be used instead. 
<P>
<DL>
  <P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--help</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Print a short help page describing the options available in rsync and 
  exit. For backward-compatibility with older versions of rsync, the help will 
  also be output if you use the <STRONG>-h</STRONG> option without any other 
  args. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--version</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>print the rsync version number and exit. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-v, --verbose</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option increases the amount of information you are given during the 
  transfer. By default, rsync works silently. A single <STRONG>-v</STRONG> will 
  give you information about what files are being transferred and a brief 
  summary at the end. Two <STRONG>-v</STRONG> flags will give you information on 
  what files are being skipped and slightly more information at the end. More 
  than two <STRONG>-v</STRONG> flags should only be used if you are debugging 
  rsync. 
  <P>Note that the names of the transferred files that are output are done using 
  a default <STRONG>--out-format</STRONG> of "%n%L", which tells you just the 
  name of the file and, if the item is a link, where it points. At the single 
  <STRONG>-v</STRONG> level of verbosity, this does not mention when a file gets 
  its attributes changed. If you ask for an itemized list of changed attributes 
  (either <STRONG>--itemize-changes</STRONG> or adding "%i" to the 
  <STRONG>--out-format</STRONG> setting), the output (on the client) increases 
  to mention all items that are changed in any way. See the 
  <STRONG>--out-format</STRONG> option for more details. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-q, --quiet</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option decreases the amount of information you are given during the 
  transfer, notably suppressing information messages from the remote server. 
  This flag is useful when invoking rsync from cron. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--no-motd</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option affects the information that is output by the client at the 
  start of a daemon transfer. This suppresses the message-of-the-day (MOTD) 
  text, but it also affects the list of modules that the daemon sends in 
  response to the "rsync host::" request (due to a limitation in the rsync 
  protocol), so omit this option if you want to request the list of modules from 
  the deamon. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-I, --ignore-times</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Normally rsync will skip any files that are already the same size and have 
  the same modification time-stamp. This option turns off this "quick check" 
  behavior, causing all files to be updated. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--size-only</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Normally rsync will not transfer any files that are already the same size 
  and have the same modification time-stamp. With the 
  <STRONG>--size-only</STRONG> option, files will not be transferred if they 
  have the same size, regardless of timestamp. This is useful when starting to 
  use rsync after using another mirroring system which may not preserve 
  timestamps exactly. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--modify-window</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>When comparing two timestamps, rsync treats the timestamps as being equal 
  if they differ by no more than the modify-window value. This is normally 0 
  (for an exact match), but you may find it useful to set this to a larger value 
  in some situations. In particular, when transferring to or from an MS Windows 
  FAT filesystem (which represents times with a 2-second resolution), 
  <STRONG>--modify-window=1</STRONG> is useful (allowing times to differ by up 
  to 1 second). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-c, --checksum</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This forces the sender to checksum <EM>every</EM> regular file using a 
  128-bit MD4 checksum. It does this during the initial file-system scan as it 
  builds the list of all available files. The receiver then checksums its 
  version of each file (if it exists and it has the same size as its sender-side 
  counterpart) in order to decide which files need to be updated: files with 
  either a changed size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer. Since 
  this whole-file checksumming of all files on both sides of the connection 
  occurs in addition to the automatic checksum verifications that occur during a 
  file's transfer, this option can be quite slow. 
  <P>Note that rsync always verifies that each <EM>transferred</EM> file was 
  correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking its whole-file 
  checksum, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do 
  with this option's before-the-transfer "Does this file need to be updated?" 
  check. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-a, --archive</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This is equivalent to <STRONG>-rlptgoD</STRONG>. It is a quick way of 
  saying you want recursion and want to preserve almost everything (with -H 
  being a notable omission). The only exception to the above equivalence is when 
  <STRONG>--files-from</STRONG> is specified, in which case <STRONG>-r</STRONG> 
  is not implied. 
  <P>Note that <STRONG>-a</STRONG> <STRONG>does not preserve hardlinks</STRONG>, 
  because finding multiply-linked files is expensive. You must separately 
  specify <STRONG>-H</STRONG>. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG>--no-OPTION</STRONG>
  <DD>You may turn off one or more implied options by prefixing the option name 
  with "no-". Not all options may be prefixed with a "no-": only options that 
  are implied by other options (e.g. <STRONG>--no-D</STRONG>, 
  <STRONG>--no-perms</STRONG>) or have different defaults in various 
  circumstances (e.g. <STRONG>--no-whole-file</STRONG>, 
  <STRONG>--no-blocking-io</STRONG>, <STRONG>--no-dirs</STRONG>). You may 
  specify either the short or the long option name after the "no-" prefix (e.g. 
  <STRONG>--no-R</STRONG> is the same as <STRONG>--no-relative</STRONG>). 
  <P>For example: if you want to use <STRONG>-a</STRONG> 
  (<STRONG>--archive</STRONG>) but don't want <STRONG>-o</STRONG> 
  (<STRONG>--owner</STRONG>), instead of converting <STRONG>-a</STRONG> into 
  <STRONG>-rlptgD</STRONG>, you could specify <STRONG>-a --no-o</STRONG> (or 
  <STRONG>-a --no-owner</STRONG>). 
  <P>The order of the options is important: if you specify <STRONG>--no-r 
  -a</STRONG>, the <STRONG>-r</STRONG> option would end up being turned on, the 
  opposite of <STRONG>-a --no-r</STRONG>. Note also that the side-effects of the 
  <STRONG>--files-from</STRONG> option are NOT positional, as it affects the 
  default state of several options and slightly changes the meaning of 
  <STRONG>-a</STRONG> (see the <STRONG>--files-from</STRONG> option for more 
  details). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-r, --recursive</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to copy directories recursively. See also 
  <STRONG>--dirs</STRONG> (<STRONG>-d</STRONG>). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-R, --relative</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Use relative paths. This means that the full path names specified on the 
  command line are sent to the server rather than just the last parts of the 
  filenames. This is particularly useful when you want to send several different 
  directories at the same time. For example, if you used this command: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -av /foo/bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>... this would create a file named baz.c in /tmp/ on the remote machine. If 
  instead you used 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -avR /foo/bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>then a file named /tmp/foo/bar/baz.c would be created on the remote machine 
  -- the full path name is preserved. To limit the amount of path information 
  that is sent, you have a couple options: (1) With a modern rsync on the 
  sending side (beginning with 2.6.7), you can insert a dot and a slash into the 
  source path, like this: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -avR /foo/./bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>That would create /tmp/bar/baz.c on the remote machine. (Note that the dot 
  must be followed by a slash, so "/foo/." would not be abbreviated.) (2) For 
  older rsync versions, you would need to use a chdir to limit the source path. 
  For example, when pushing files: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>(cd /foo; rsync -avR bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/) 
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(Note that the parens put the two commands into a sub-shell, so that the 
  "cd" command doesn't remain in effect for future commands.) If you're pulling 
  files, use this idiom (which doesn't work with an rsync daemon): 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -avR --rsync-path="cd /foo; rsync" \ 
    </CODE><BR><CODE>remote:bar/baz.c /tmp/</CODE> </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--no-implied-dirs</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option affects the default behavior of the 
  <STRONG>--relative</STRONG> option. When it is specified, the attributes of 
  the implied directories from the source names are not included in the 
  transfer. This means that the corresponding path elements on the destination 
  system are left unchanged if they exist, and any missing implied directories 
  are created with default attributes. This even allows these implied path 
  elements to have big differences, such as being a symlink to a directory on 
  one side of the transfer, and a real directory on the other side. 
  <P>For instance, if a command-line arg or a files-from entry told rsync to 
  transfer the file "path/foo/file", the directories "path" and "path/foo" are 
  implied when <STRONG>--relative</STRONG> is used. If "path/foo" is a symlink 
  to "bar" on the destination system, the receiving rsync would ordinarily 
  delete "path/foo", recreate it as a directory, and receive the file into the 
  new directory. With <STRONG>--no-implied-dirs</STRONG>, the receiving rsync 
  updates "path/foo/file" using the existing path elements, which means that the 
  file ends up being created in "path/bar". Another way to accomplish this link 
  preservation is to use the <STRONG>--keep-dirlinks</STRONG> option (which will 
  also affect symlinks to directories in the rest of the transfer). 
  <P>In a similar but opposite scenario, if the transfer of "path/foo/file" is 
  requested and "path/foo" is a symlink on the sending side, running without 
  <STRONG>--no-implied-dirs</STRONG> would cause rsync to transform "path/foo" 
  on the receiving side into an identical symlink, and then attempt to transfer 
  "path/foo/file", which might fail if the duplicated symlink did not point to a 
  directory on the receiving side. Another way to avoid this sending of a 
  symlink as an implied directory is to use 
  <STRONG>--copy-unsafe-links</STRONG>, or <STRONG>--copy-dirlinks</STRONG> 
  (both of which also affect symlinks in the rest of the transfer -- see their 
  descriptions for full details). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-b, --backup</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>With this option, preexisting destination files are renamed as each file 
  is transferred or deleted. You can control where the backup file goes and what 
  (if any) suffix gets appended using the <STRONG>--backup-dir</STRONG> and 
  <STRONG>--suffix</STRONG> options. 
  <P>Note that if you don't specify <STRONG>--backup-dir</STRONG>, (1) the 
  <STRONG>--omit-dir-times</STRONG> option will be implied, and (2) if 
  <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> is also in effect (without 
  <STRONG>--delete-excluded</STRONG>), rsync will add a "protect" filter-rule 
  for the backup suffix to the end of all your existing excludes (e.g. -f "P 
  *~"). This will prevent previously backed-up files from being deleted. Note 
  that if you are supplying your own filter rules, you may need to manually 
  insert your own exclude/protect rule somewhere higher up in the list so that 
  it has a high enough priority to be effective (e.g., if your rules specify a 
  trailing inclusion/exclusion of '*', the auto-added rule would never be 
  reached). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--backup-dir=DIR</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>In combination with the <STRONG>--backup</STRONG> option, this tells rsync 
  to store all backups in the specified directory on the receiving side. This 
  can be used for incremental backups. You can additionally specify a backup 
  suffix using the <STRONG>--suffix</STRONG> option (otherwise the files backed 
  up in the specified directory will keep their original filenames). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--suffix=SUFFIX</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option allows you to override the default backup suffix used with the 
  <STRONG>--backup</STRONG> (<STRONG>-b</STRONG>) option. The default suffix is 
  a ~ if no -<STRONG>-backup-dir</STRONG> was specified, otherwise it is an 
  empty string. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-u, --update</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This forces rsync to skip any files which exist on the destination and 
  have a modified time that is newer than the source file. (If an existing 
  destination file has a modify time equal to the source file's, it will be 
  updated if the sizes are different.) 
  <P>In the current implementation of <STRONG>--update</STRONG>, a difference of 
  file format between the sender and receiver is always considered to be 
  important enough for an update, no matter what date is on the objects. In 
  other words, if the source has a directory or a symlink where the destination 
  has a file, the transfer would occur regardless of the timestamps. This might 
  change in the future (feel free to comment on this on the mailing list if you 
  have an opinion). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--inplace</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This causes rsync not to create a new copy of the file and then move it 
  into place. Instead rsync will overwrite the existing file, meaning that the 
  rsync algorithm can't accomplish the full amount of network reduction it might 
  be able to otherwise (since it does not yet try to sort data matches). One 
  exception to this is if you combine the option with <STRONG>--backup</STRONG>, 
  since rsync is smart enough to use the backup file as the basis file for the 
  transfer. 
  <P>This option is useful for transfer of large files with block-based changes 
  or appended data, and also on systems that are disk bound, not network bound. 
  <P>The option implies <STRONG>--partial</STRONG> (since an interrupted 
  transfer does not delete the file), but conflicts with 
  <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG> and <STRONG>--delay-updates</STRONG>. Prior to 
  rsync 2.6.4 <STRONG>--inplace</STRONG> was also incompatible with 
  <STRONG>--compare-dest</STRONG> and <STRONG>--link-dest</STRONG>. 
  <P>WARNING: The file's data will be in an inconsistent state during the 
  transfer (and possibly afterward if the transfer gets interrupted), so you 
  should not use this option to update files that are in use. Also note that 
  rsync will be unable to update a file in-place that is not writable by the 
  receiving user. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--append</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This causes rsync to update a file by appending data onto the end of the 
  file, which presumes that the data that already exists on the receiving side 
  is identical with the start of the file on the sending side. If that is not 
  true, the file will fail the checksum test, and the resend will do a normal 
  <STRONG>--inplace</STRONG> update to correct the mismatched data. Only files 
  on the receiving side that are shorter than the corresponding file on the 
  sending side (as well as new files) are sent. Implies 
  <STRONG>--inplace</STRONG>, but does not conflict with 
  <STRONG>--sparse</STRONG> (though the <STRONG>--sparse</STRONG> option will be 
  auto-disabled if a resend of the already-existing data is required). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-d, --dirs</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Tell the sending side to include any directories that are encountered. 
  Unlike <STRONG>--recursive</STRONG>, a directory's contents are not copied 
  unless the directory name specified is "." or ends with a trailing slash (e.g. 
  ".", "dir/.", "dir/", etc.). Without this option or the 
  <STRONG>--recursive</STRONG> option, rsync will skip all directories it 
  encounters (and output a message to that effect for each one). If you specify 
  both <STRONG>--dirs</STRONG> and <STRONG>--recursive</STRONG>, 
  <STRONG>--recursive</STRONG> takes precedence. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-l, --links</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>When symlinks are encountered, recreate the symlink on the destination. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-L, --copy-links</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>When symlinks are encountered, the item that they point to (the referent) 
  is copied, rather than the symlink. In older versions of rsync, this option 
  also had the side-effect of telling the receiving side to follow symlinks, 
  such as symlinks to directories. In a modern rsync such as this one, you'll 
  need to specify <STRONG>--keep-dirlinks</STRONG> (<STRONG>-K</STRONG>) to get 
  this extra behavior. The only exception is when sending files to an rsync that 
  is too old to understand <STRONG>-K</STRONG> -- in that case, the 
  <STRONG>-L</STRONG> option will still have the side-effect of 
  <STRONG>-K</STRONG> on that older receiving rsync. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--copy-unsafe-links</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to copy the referent of symbolic links that point outside 
  the copied tree. Absolute symlinks are also treated like ordinary files, and 
  so are any symlinks in the source path itself when <STRONG>--relative</STRONG> 
  is used. This option has no additional effect if <STRONG>--copy-links</STRONG> 
  was also specified. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--safe-links</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to ignore any symbolic links which point outside the 
  copied tree. All absolute symlinks are also ignored. Using this option in 
  conjunction with <STRONG>--relative</STRONG> may give unexpected results. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-K, --copy-dirlinks</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option causes the sending side to treat a symlink to a directory as 
  though it were a real directory. This is useful if you don't want symlinks to 
  non-directories to be affected, as they would be using 
  <STRONG>--copy-links</STRONG>. 
  <P>Without this option, if the sending side has replaced a directory with a 
  symlink to a directory, the receiving side will delete anything that is in the 
  way of the new symlink, including a directory hierarchy (as long as 
  <STRONG>--force</STRONG> or <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> is in effect). 
  <P>See also <STRONG>--keep-dirlinks</STRONG> for an analogous option for the 
  receiving side. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-K, --keep-dirlinks</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option causes the receiving side to treat a symlink to a directory as 
  though it were a real directory, but only if it matches a real directory from 
  the sender. Without this option, the receiver's symlink would be deleted and 
  replaced with a real directory. 
  <P>For example, suppose you transfer a directory "foo" that contains a file 
  "file", but "foo" is a symlink to directory "bar" on the receiver. Without 
  <STRONG>--keep-dirlinks</STRONG>, the receiver deletes symlink "foo", 
  recreates it as a directory, and receives the file into the new directory. 
  With <STRONG>--keep-dirlinks</STRONG>, the receiver keeps the symlink and 
  "file" ends up in "bar". 
  <P>See also <STRONG>--copy-dirlinks</STRONG> for an analogous option for the 
  sending side. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-H, --hard-links</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to look for hard-linked files in the transfer and link 
  together the corresponding files on the receiving side. Without this option, 
  hard-linked files in the transfer are treated as though they were separate 
  files. 
  <P>Note that rsync can only detect hard links if both parts of the link are in 
  the list of files being sent. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-p, --perms</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option causes the receiving rsync to set the destination permissions 
  to be the same as the source permissions. (See also the 
  <STRONG>--chmod</STRONG> option for a way to modify what rsync considers to be 
  the source permissions.) 
  <P>When this option is <EM>off</EM>, permissions are set as follows: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <LI>Existing files (including updated files) retain their existing 
      permissions, though the <STRONG>--executability</STRONG> option might 
      change just the execute permission for the file. 
      <LI>New files get their "normal" permission bits set to the source file's 
      permissions masked with the receiving end's umask setting, and their 
      special permission bits disabled except in the case where a new directory 
      inherits a setgid bit from its parent directory. </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Thus, when <STRONG>--perms</STRONG> and <STRONG>--executability</STRONG> 
  are both disabled, rsync's behavior is the same as that of other file-copy 
  utilities, such as <STRONG>cp</STRONG>(1) and <STRONG>tar</STRONG>(1). 
  <P>In summary: to give destination files (both old and new) the source 
  permissions, use <STRONG>--perms</STRONG>. To give new files the 
  destination-default permissions (while leaving existing files unchanged), make 
  sure that the <STRONG>--perms</STRONG> option is off and use 
  <STRONG>--chmod=ugo=rwX</STRONG> (which ensures that all non-masked bits get 
  enabled). If you'd care to make this latter behavior easier to type, you could 
  define a popt alias for it, such as putting this line in the file ~/.popt 
  (this defines the <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option, and includes --no-g to use the 
  default group of the destination dir): 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync alias -s --no-p --no-g 
  --chmod=ugo=rwX</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>You could then use this new option in a command such as this one: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -asv src/ dest/</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(Caveat: make sure that <STRONG>-a</STRONG> does not follow 
  <STRONG>-s</STRONG>, or it will re-enable the "--no-*" options.) 
  <P>The preservation of the destination's setgid bit on newly-created 
  directories when <STRONG>--perms</STRONG> is off was added in rsync 2.6.7. 
  Older rsync versions erroneously preserved the three special permission bits 
  for newly-created files when <STRONG>--perms</STRONG> was off, while 
  overriding the destination's setgid bit setting on a newly-created directory. 
  (Keep in mind that it is the version of the receiving rsync that affects this 
  behavior.) 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-E, --executability</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option causes rsync to preserve the executability (or 
  non-executability) of regular files when <STRONG>--perms</STRONG> is not 
  enabled. A regular file is considered to be executable if at least one 'x' is 
  turned on in its permissions. When an existing destination file's 
  executability differs from that of the corresponding source file, rsync 
  modifies the destination file's permissions as follows: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <LI>To make a file non-executable, rsync turns off all its 'x' 
      permissions. 
      <LI>To make a file executable, rsync turns on each 'x' permission that has 
      a corresponding 'r' permission enabled. </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>If <STRONG>--perms</STRONG> is enabled, this option is ignored. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--chmod</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option tells rsync to apply one or more comma-separated "chmod" 
  strings to the permission of the files in the transfer. The resulting value is 
  treated as though it was the permissions that the sending side supplied for 
  the file, which means that this option can seem to have no effect on existing 
  files if <STRONG>--perms</STRONG> is not enabled. 
  <P>In addition to the normal parsing rules specified in the 
  <STRONG>chmod</STRONG>(1) manpage, you can specify an item that should only 
  apply to a directory by prefixing it with a 'D', or specify an item that 
  should only apply to a file by prefixing it with a 'F'. For example: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>--chmod=Dg+s,ug+w,Fo-w,+X</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>It is also legal to specify multiple <STRONG>--chmod</STRONG> options, as 
  each additional option is just appended to the list of changes to make. 
  <P>See the <STRONG>--perms</STRONG> and <STRONG>--executability</STRONG> 
  options for how the resulting permission value can be applied to the files in 
  the transfer. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-o, --owner</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option causes rsync to set the owner of the destination file to be 
  the same as the source file, but only if the receiving rsync is being run as 
  the super-user (see also the <STRONG>--super</STRONG> option to force rsync to 
  attempt super-user activities). Without this option, the owner is set to the 
  invoking user on the receiving side. 
  <P>The preservation of ownership will associate matching names by default, but 
  may fall back to using the ID number in some circumstances (see also the 
  <STRONG>--numeric-ids</STRONG> option for a full discussion). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-g, --group</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option causes rsync to set the group of the destination file to be 
  the same as the source file. If the receiving program is not running as the 
  super-user (or if <STRONG>--no-super</STRONG> was specified), only groups that 
  the invoking user on the receiving side is a member of will be preserved. 
  Without this option, the group is set to the default group of the invoking 
  user on the receiving side. 
  <P>The preservation of group information will associate matching names by 
  default, but may fall back to using the ID number in some circumstances (see 
  also the <STRONG>--numeric-ids</STRONG> option for a full discussion). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--devices</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option causes rsync to transfer character and block device files to 
  the remote system to recreate these devices. This option has no effect if the 
  receiving rsync is not run as the super-user and <STRONG>--super</STRONG> is 
  not specified. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--specials</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option causes rsync to transfer special files such as named sockets 
  and fifos. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-D</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>The <STRONG>-D</STRONG> option is equivalent to <STRONG>--devices</STRONG> 
  <STRONG>--specials</STRONG>. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-t, --times</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to transfer modification times along with the files and 
  update them on the remote system. Note that if this option is not used, the 
  optimization that excludes files that have not been modified cannot be 
  effective; in other words, a missing <STRONG>-t</STRONG> or 
  <STRONG>-a</STRONG> will cause the next transfer to behave as if it used 
  <STRONG>-I</STRONG>, causing all files to be updated (though the rsync 
  algorithm will make the update fairly efficient if the files haven't actually 
  changed, you're much better off using <STRONG>-t</STRONG>). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-O, --omit-dir-times</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to omit directories when it is preserving modification 
  times (see <STRONG>--times</STRONG>). If NFS is sharing the directories on the 
  receiving side, it is a good idea to use <STRONG>-O</STRONG>. This option is 
  inferred if you use <STRONG>--backup</STRONG> without 
  <STRONG>--backup-dir</STRONG>. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--super</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells the receiving side to attempt super-user activities even if the 
  receiving rsync wasn't run by the super-user. These activities include: 
  preserving users via the <STRONG>--owner</STRONG> option, preserving all 
  groups (not just the current user's groups) via the <STRONG>--groups</STRONG> 
  option, and copying devices via the <STRONG>--devices</STRONG> option. This is 
  useful for systems that allow such activities without being the super-user, 
  and also for ensuring that you will get errors if the receiving side isn't 
  being running as the super-user. To turn off super-user activities, the 
  super-user can use <STRONG>--no-super</STRONG>. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-S, --sparse</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Try to handle sparse files efficiently so they take up less space on the 
  destination. Conflicts with <STRONG>--inplace</STRONG> because it's not 
  possible to overwrite data in a sparse fashion. 
  <P>NOTE: Don't use this option when the destination is a Solaris "tmpfs" 
  filesystem. It doesn't seem to handle seeks over null regions correctly and 
  ends up corrupting the files. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-n, --dry-run</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to not do any file transfers, instead it will just report 
  the actions it would have taken. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-W, --whole-file</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>With this option the incremental rsync algorithm is not used and the whole 
  file is sent as-is instead. The transfer may be faster if this option is used 
  when the bandwidth between the source and destination machines is higher than 
  the bandwidth to disk (especially when the "disk" is actually a networked 
  filesystem). This is the default when both the source and destination are 
  specified as local paths. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-x, --one-file-system</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to avoid crossing a filesystem boundary when recursing. 
  This does not limit the user's ability to specify items to copy from multiple 
  filesystems, just rsync's recursion through the hierarchy of each directory 
  that the user specified, and also the analogous recursion on the receiving 
  side during deletion. Also keep in mind that rsync treats a "bind" mount to 
  the same device as being on the same filesystem. 
  <P>If this option is repeated, rsync omits all mount-point directories from 
  the copy. Otherwise, it includes an empty directory at each mount-point it 
  encounters (using the attributes of the mounted directory because those of the 
  underlying mount-point directory are inaccessible). 
  <P>If rsync has been told to collapse symlinks (via 
  <STRONG>--copy-links</STRONG> or <STRONG>--copy-unsafe-links</STRONG>), a 
  symlink to a directory on another device is treated like a mount-point. 
  Symlinks to non-directories are unaffected by this option. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--existing, --ignore-non-existing</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to skip creating files (including directories) that do 
  not exist yet on the destination. If this option is combined with the 
  <STRONG>--ignore-existing</STRONG> option, no files will be updated (which can 
  be useful if all you want to do is to delete extraneous files). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--ignore-existing</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to skip updating files that already exist on the 
  destination (this does <EM>not</EM> ignore existing directores, or nothing 
  would get done). See also <STRONG>--existing</STRONG>. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--remove-source-files</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to remove from the sending side the files (meaning 
  non-directories) that are a part of the transfer and have been successfully 
  duplicated on the receiving side. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--delete</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving side (ones 
  that aren't on the sending side), but only for the directories that are being 
  synchronized. You must have asked rsync to send the whole directory (e.g. 
  "dir" or "dir/") without using a wildcard for the directory's contents (e.g. 
  "dir/*") since the wildcard is expanded by the shell and rsync thus gets a 
  request to transfer individual files, not the files' parent directory. Files 
  that are excluded from transfer are also excluded from being deleted unless 
  you use the <STRONG>--delete-excluded</STRONG> option or mark the rules as 
  only matching on the sending side (see the include/exclude modifiers in the 
  FILTER RULES section). 
  <P>Prior to rsync 2.6.7, this option would have no effect unless 
  <STRONG>--recursive</STRONG> was in effect. Beginning with 2.6.7, deletions 
  will also occur when <STRONG>--dirs</STRONG> (<STRONG>-d</STRONG>) is in 
  effect, but only for directories whose contents are being copied. 
  <P>This option can be dangerous if used incorrectly! It is a very good idea to 
  run first using the <STRONG>--dry-run</STRONG> option (<STRONG>-n</STRONG>) to 
  see what files would be deleted to make sure important files aren't listed. 
  <P>If the sending side detects any I/O errors, then the deletion of any files 
  at the destination will be automatically disabled. This is to prevent 
  temporary filesystem failures (such as NFS errors) on the sending side causing 
  a massive deletion of files on the destination. You can override this with the 
  <STRONG>--ignore-errors</STRONG> option. 
  <P>The <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> option may be combined with one of the 
  --delete-WHEN options without conflict, as well as 
  <STRONG>--delete-excluded</STRONG>. However, if none of the --delete-WHEN 
  options are specified, rsync will currently choose the 
  <STRONG>--delete-before</STRONG> algorithm. A future version may change this 
  to choose the <STRONG>--delete-during</STRONG> algorithm. See also 
  <STRONG>--delete-after</STRONG>. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--delete-before</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done before the 
  transfer starts. This is the default if <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> or 
  <STRONG>--delete-excluded</STRONG> is specified without one of the 
  --delete-WHEN options. See <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> (which is implied) for 
  more details on file-deletion. 
  <P>Deleting before the transfer is helpful if the filesystem is tight for 
  space and removing extraneous files would help to make the transfer possible. 
  However, it does introduce a delay before the start of the transfer, and this 
  delay might cause the transfer to timeout (if <STRONG>--timeout</STRONG> was 
  specified). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--delete-during, --del</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done 
  incrementally as the transfer happens. This is a faster method than choosing 
  the before- or after-transfer algorithm, but it is only supported beginning 
  with rsync version 2.6.4. See <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> (which is implied) for 
  more details on file-deletion. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--delete-after</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done after the 
  transfer has completed. This is useful if you are sending new per-directory 
  merge files as a part of the transfer and you want their exclusions to take 
  effect for the delete phase of the current transfer. See 
  <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> (which is implied) for more details on 
  file-deletion. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--delete-excluded</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>In addition to deleting the files on the receiving side that are not on 
  the sending side, this tells rsync to also delete any files on the receiving 
  side that are excluded (see <STRONG>--exclude</STRONG>). See the FILTER RULES 
  section for a way to make individual exclusions behave this way on the 
  receiver, and for a way to protect files from 
  <STRONG>--delete-excluded</STRONG>. See <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> (which is 
  implied) for more details on file-deletion. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--ignore-errors</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Tells <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> to go ahead and delete files even when 
  there are I/O errors. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--force</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option tells rsync to delete a non-empty directory when it is to be 
  replaced by a non-directory. This is only relevant if deletions are not active 
  (see <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> for details). 
  <P>Note for older rsync versions: <STRONG>--force</STRONG> used to still be 
  required when using <STRONG>--delete-after</STRONG>, and it used to be 
  non-functional unless the <STRONG>--recursive</STRONG> option was also 
  enabled. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--max-delete=NUM</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync not to delete more than NUM files or directories (NUM 
  must be non-zero). This is useful when mirroring very large trees to prevent 
  disasters. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--max-size=SIZE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to avoid transferring any file that is larger than the 
  specified SIZE. The SIZE value can be suffixed with a string to indicate a 
  size multiplier, and may be a fractional value (e.g. 
  "<STRONG>--max-size=1.5m</STRONG>"). 
  <P>The suffixes are as follows: "K" (or "KiB") is a kibibyte (1024), "M" (or 
  "MiB") is a mebibyte (1024*1024), and "G" (or "GiB") is a gibibyte 
  (1024*1024*1024). If you want the multiplier to be 1000 instead of 1024, use 
  "KB", "MB", or "GB". (Note: lower-case is also accepted for all values.) 
  Finally, if the suffix ends in either "+1" or "-1", the value will be offset 
  by one byte in the indicated direction. 
  <P>Examples: --max-size=1.5mb-1 is 1499999 bytes, and --max-size=2g+1 is 
  2147483649 bytes. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--min-size=SIZE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to avoid transferring any file that is smaller than the 
  specified SIZE, which can help in not transferring small, junk files. See the 
  <STRONG>--max-size</STRONG> option for a description of SIZE. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-B, --block-size=BLOCKSIZE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This forces the block size used in the rsync algorithm to a fixed value. 
  It is normally selected based on the size of each file being updated. See the 
  technical report for details. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-e, --rsh=COMMAND</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program to 
  use for communication between the local and remote copies of rsync. Typically, 
  rsync is configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a 
  local network. 
  <P>If this option is used with <STRONG>[user@]host::module/path</STRONG>, then 
  the remote shell <EM>COMMAND</EM> will be used to run an rsync daemon on the 
  remote host, and all data will be transmitted through that remote shell 
  connection, rather than through a direct socket connection to a running rsync 
  daemon on the remote host. See the section "USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A 
  REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION" above. 
  <P>Command-line arguments are permitted in COMMAND provided that COMMAND is 
  presented to rsync as a single argument. You must use spaces (not tabs or 
  other whitespace) to separate the command and args from each other, and you 
  can use single- and/or double-quotes to preserve spaces in an argument (but 
  not backslashes). Note that doubling a single-quote inside a single-quoted 
  string gives you a single-quote; likewise for double-quotes (though you need 
  to pay attention to which quotes your shell is parsing and which quotes rsync 
  is parsing). Some examples: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>-e 'ssh -p 2234'</CODE><BR><CODE>-e 'ssh -o "ProxyCommand 
    nohup ssh firewall nc -w1 %h %p"'</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(Note that ssh users can alternately customize site-specific connect 
  options in their .ssh/config file.) 
  <P>You can also choose the remote shell program using the RSYNC_RSH 
  environment variable, which accepts the same range of values as 
  <STRONG>-e</STRONG>. 
  <P>See also the <STRONG>--blocking-io</STRONG> option which is affected by 
  this option. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--rsync-path=PROGRAM</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Use this to specify what program is to be run on the remote machine to 
  start-up rsync. Often used when rsync is not in the default remote-shell's 
  path (e.g. --rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync). Note that PROGRAM is run with 
  the help of a shell, so it can be any program, script, or command sequence 
  you'd care to run, so long as it does not corrupt the standard-in &amp; 
  standard-out that rsync is using to communicate. 
  <P>One tricky example is to set a different default directory on the remote 
  machine for use with the <STRONG>--relative</STRONG> option. For instance: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -avR --rsync-path="cd /a/b &amp;&amp; rsync" hst:c/d 
    /e/</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-C, --cvs-exclude</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This is a useful shorthand for excluding a broad range of files that you 
  often don't want to transfer between systems. It uses the same algorithm that 
  CVS uses to determine if a file should be ignored. 
  <P>The exclude list is initialized to: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>RCS SCCS CVS CVS.adm RCSLOG cvslog.* tags TAGS 
      .make.state .nse_depinfo *~ #* .#* ,* _$* *$ *.old *.bak *.BAK *.orig 
      *.rej .del-* *.a *.olb *.o *.obj *.so *.exe *.Z *.elc *.ln core 
      .svn/</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>then files listed in a $HOME/.cvsignore are added to the list and any files 
  listed in the CVSIGNORE environment variable (all cvsignore names are 
  delimited by whitespace). 
  <P>Finally, any file is ignored if it is in the same directory as a .cvsignore 
  file and matches one of the patterns listed therein. Unlike rsync's 
  filter/exclude files, these patterns are split on whitespace. See the 
  <STRONG>cvs</STRONG>(1) manual for more information. 
  <P>If you're combining <STRONG>-C</STRONG> with your own 
  <STRONG>--filter</STRONG> rules, you should note that these CVS excludes are 
  appended at the end of your own rules, regardless of where the 
  <STRONG>-C</STRONG> was placed on the command-line. This makes them a lower 
  priority than any rules you specified explicitly. If you want to control where 
  these CVS excludes get inserted into your filter rules, you should omit the 
  <STRONG>-C</STRONG> as a command-line option and use a combination of 
  <STRONG>--filter=:C</STRONG> and <STRONG>--filter=-C</STRONG> (either on your 
  command-line or by putting the ":C" and "-C" rules into a filter file with 
  your other rules). The first option turns on the per-directory scanning for 
  the .cvsignore file. The second option does a one-time import of the CVS 
  excludes mentioned above. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-f, --filter=RULE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option allows you to add rules to selectively exclude certain files 
  from the list of files to be transferred. This is most useful in combination 
  with a recursive transfer. 
  <P>You may use as many <STRONG>--filter</STRONG> options on the command line 
  as you like to build up the list of files to exclude. 
  <P>See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on this option. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-F</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>The <STRONG>-F</STRONG> option is a shorthand for adding two 
  <STRONG>--filter</STRONG> rules to your command. The first time it is used is 
  a shorthand for this rule: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>--filter='dir-merge /.rsync-filter'</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This tells rsync to look for per-directory .rsync-filter files that have 
  been sprinkled through the hierarchy and use their rules to filter the files 
  in the transfer. If <STRONG>-F</STRONG> is repeated, it is a shorthand for 
  this rule: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>--filter='exclude .rsync-filter'</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This filters out the .rsync-filter files themselves from the transfer. 
  <P>See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on how these options 
  work. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--exclude=PATTERN</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option is a simplified form of the <STRONG>--filter</STRONG> option 
  that defaults to an exclude rule and does not allow the full rule-parsing 
  syntax of normal filter rules. 
  <P>See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on this option. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--exclude-from=FILE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option is related to the <STRONG>--exclude</STRONG> option, but it 
  specifies a FILE that contains exclude patterns (one per line). Blank lines in 
  the file and lines starting with ';' or '#' are ignored. If <EM>FILE</EM> is 
  <STRONG>-</STRONG>, the list will be read from standard input. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--include=PATTERN</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option is a simplified form of the <STRONG>--filter</STRONG> option 
  that defaults to an include rule and does not allow the full rule-parsing 
  syntax of normal filter rules. 
  <P>See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on this option. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--include-from=FILE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option is related to the <STRONG>--include</STRONG> option, but it 
  specifies a FILE that contains include patterns (one per line). Blank lines in 
  the file and lines starting with ';' or '#' are ignored. If <EM>FILE</EM> is 
  <STRONG>-</STRONG>, the list will be read from standard input. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--files-from=FILE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Using this option allows you to specify the exact list of files to 
  transfer (as read from the specified FILE or <STRONG>-</STRONG> for standard 
  input). It also tweaks the default behavior of rsync to make transferring just 
  the specified files and directories easier: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <LI>The <STRONG>--relative</STRONG> (<STRONG>-R</STRONG>) option is 
      implied, which preserves the path information that is specified for each 
      item in the file (use <STRONG>--no-relative</STRONG> or 
      <STRONG>--no-R</STRONG> if you want to turn that off). 
      <LI>The <STRONG>--dirs</STRONG> (<STRONG>-d</STRONG>) option is implied, 
      which will create directories specified in the list on the destination 
      rather than noisily skipping them (use <STRONG>--no-dirs</STRONG> or 
      <STRONG>--no-d</STRONG> if you want to turn that off). 
      <LI>The <STRONG>--archive</STRONG> (<STRONG>-a</STRONG>) option's behavior 
      does not imply <STRONG>--recursive</STRONG> (<STRONG>-r</STRONG>), so 
      specify it explicitly, if you want it. 
      <LI>These side-effects change the default state of rsync, so the position 
      of the <STRONG>--files-from</STRONG> option on the command-line has no 
      bearing on how other options are parsed (e.g. <STRONG>-a</STRONG> works 
      the same before or after <STRONG>--files-from</STRONG>, as does 
      <STRONG>--no-R</STRONG> and all other options). </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The file names that are read from the FILE are all relative to the source 
  dir -- any leading slashes are removed and no ".." references are allowed to 
  go higher than the source dir. For example, take this command: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -a --files-from=/tmp/foo /usr 
  remote:/backup</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>If /tmp/foo contains the string "bin" (or even "/bin"), the /usr/bin 
  directory will be created as /backup/bin on the remote host. If it contains 
  "bin/" (note the trailing slash), the immediate contents of the directory 
  would also be sent (without needing to be explicitly mentioned in the file -- 
  this began in version 2.6.4). In both cases, if the <STRONG>-r</STRONG> option 
  was enabled, that dir's entire hierarchy would also be transferred (keep in 
  mind that <STRONG>-r</STRONG> needs to be specified explicitly with 
  <STRONG>--files-from</STRONG>, since it is not implied by 
  <STRONG>-a</STRONG>). Also note that the effect of the (enabled by default) 
  <STRONG>--relative</STRONG> option is to duplicate only the path info that is 
  read from the file -- it does not force the duplication of the source-spec 
  path (/usr in this case). 
  <P>In addition, the <STRONG>--files-from</STRONG> file can be read from the 
  remote host instead of the local host if you specify a "host:" in front of the 
  file (the host must match one end of the transfer). As a short-cut, you can 
  specify just a prefix of ":" to mean "use the remote end of the transfer". For 
  example: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -a --files-from=:/path/file-list src:/ 
    /tmp/copy</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This would copy all the files specified in the /path/file-list file that 
  was located on the remote "src" host. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-0, --from0</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync that the rules/filenames it reads from a file are 
  terminated by a null ('\0') character, not a NL, CR, or CR+LF. This affects 
  <STRONG>--exclude-from</STRONG>, <STRONG>--include-from</STRONG>, 
  <STRONG>--files-from</STRONG>, and any merged files specified in a 
  <STRONG>--filter</STRONG> rule. It does not affect 
  <STRONG>--cvs-exclude</STRONG> (since all names read from a .cvsignore file 
  are split on whitespace). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-T, --temp-dir=DIR</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option instructs rsync to use DIR as a scratch directory when 
  creating temporary copies of the files transferred on the receiving side. The 
  default behavior is to create each temporary file in the same directory as the 
  associated destination file. 
  <P>This option is most often used when the receiving disk partition does not 
  have enough free space to hold a copy of the largest file in the transfer. In 
  this case (i.e. when the scratch directory in on a different disk partition), 
  rsync will not be able to rename each received temporary file over the top of 
  the associated destination file, but instead must copy it into place. Rsync 
  does this by copying the file over the top of the destination file, which 
  means that the destination file will contain truncated data during this copy. 
  If this were not done this way (even if the destination file were first 
  removed, the data locally copied to a temporary file in the destination 
  directory, and then renamed into place) it would be possible for the old file 
  to continue taking up disk space (if someone had it open), and thus there 
  might not be enough room to fit the new version on the disk at the same time. 
  <P>If you are using this option for reasons other than a shortage of disk 
  space, you may wish to combine it with the <STRONG>--delay-updates</STRONG> 
  option, which will ensure that all copied files get put into subdirectories in 
  the destination hierarchy, awaiting the end of the transfer. If you don't have 
  enough room to duplicate all the arriving files on the destination partition, 
  another way to tell rsync that you aren't overly concerned about disk space is 
  to use the <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG> option with a relative path; because 
  this tells rsync that it is OK to stash off a copy of a single file in a 
  subdir in the destination hierarchy, rsync will use the partial-dir as a 
  staging area to bring over the copied file, and then rename it into place from 
  there. (Specifying a <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG> with an absolute path does 
  not have this side-effect.) 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-y, --fuzzy</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option tells rsync that it should look for a basis file for any 
  destination file that is missing. The current algorithm looks in the same 
  directory as the destination file for either a file that has an identical size 
  and modified-time, or a similarly-named file. If found, rsync uses the fuzzy 
  basis file to try to speed up the transfer. 
  <P>Note that the use of the <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> option might get rid of 
  any potential fuzzy-match files, so either use <STRONG>--delete-after</STRONG> 
  or specify some filename exclusions if you need to prevent this. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--compare-dest=DIR</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option instructs rsync to use <EM>DIR</EM> on the destination machine 
  as an additional hierarchy to compare destination files against doing 
  transfers (if the files are missing in the destination directory). If a file 
  is found in <EM>DIR</EM> that is identical to the sender's file, the file will 
  NOT be transferred to the destination directory. This is useful for creating a 
  sparse backup of just files that have changed from an earlier backup. 
  <P>Beginning in version 2.6.4, multiple <STRONG>--compare-dest</STRONG> 
  directories may be provided, which will cause rsync to search the list in the 
  order specified for an exact match. If a match is found that differs only in 
  attributes, a local copy is made and the attributes updated. If a match is not 
  found, a basis file from one of the <EM>DIR</EM>s will be selected to try to 
  speed up the transfer. 
  <P>If <EM>DIR</EM> is a relative path, it is relative to the destination 
  directory. See also <STRONG>--copy-dest</STRONG> and 
  <STRONG>--link-dest</STRONG>. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--copy-dest=DIR</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option behaves like <STRONG>--compare-dest</STRONG>, but rsync will 
  also copy unchanged files found in <EM>DIR</EM> to the destination directory 
  using a local copy. This is useful for doing transfers to a new destination 
  while leaving existing files intact, and then doing a flash-cutover when all 
  files have been successfully transferred. 
  <P>Multiple <STRONG>--copy-dest</STRONG> directories may be provided, which 
  will cause rsync to search the list in the order specified for an unchanged 
  file. If a match is not found, a basis file from one of the <EM>DIR</EM>s will 
  be selected to try to speed up the transfer. 
  <P>If <EM>DIR</EM> is a relative path, it is relative to the destination 
  directory. See also <STRONG>--compare-dest</STRONG> and 
  <STRONG>--link-dest</STRONG>. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--link-dest=DIR</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option behaves like <STRONG>--copy-dest</STRONG>, but unchanged files 
  are hard linked from <EM>DIR</EM> to the destination directory. The files must 
  be identical in all preserved attributes (e.g. permissions, possibly 
  ownership) in order for the files to be linked together. An example: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -av --link-dest=$PWD/prior_dir host:src_dir/ 
    new_dir/</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Beginning in version 2.6.4, multiple <STRONG>--link-dest</STRONG> 
  directories may be provided, which will cause rsync to search the list in the 
  order specified for an exact match. If a match is found that differs only in 
  attributes, a local copy is made and the attributes updated. If a match is not 
  found, a basis file from one of the <EM>DIR</EM>s will be selected to try to 
  speed up the transfer. 
  <P>Note that if you combine this option with <STRONG>--ignore-times</STRONG>, 
  rsync will not link any files together because it only links identical files 
  together as a substitute for transferring the file, never as an additional 
  check after the file is updated. 
  <P>If <EM>DIR</EM> is a relative path, it is relative to the destination 
  directory. See also <STRONG>--compare-dest</STRONG> and 
  <STRONG>--copy-dest</STRONG>. 
  <P>Note that rsync versions prior to 2.6.1 had a bug that could prevent 
  <STRONG>--link-dest</STRONG> from working properly for a non-super-user when 
  <STRONG>-o</STRONG> was specified (or implied by <STRONG>-a</STRONG>). You can 
  work-around this bug by avoiding the <STRONG>-o</STRONG> option when sending 
  to an old rsync. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-z, --compress</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>With this option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent to the 
  destination machine, which reduces the amount of data being transmitted -- 
  something that is useful over a slow connection. 
  <P>Note that this option typically achieves better compression ratios than can 
  be achieved by using a compressing remote shell or a compressing transport 
  because it takes advantage of the implicit information in the matching data 
  blocks that are not explicitly sent over the connection. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--compress-level=NUM</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Explicitly set the compression level to use (see 
  <STRONG>--compress</STRONG>) instead of letting it default. If NUM is 
  non-zero, the <STRONG>--compress</STRONG> option is implied. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--numeric-ids</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>With this option rsync will transfer numeric group and user IDs rather 
  than using user and group names and mapping them at both ends. 
  <P>By default rsync will use the username and groupname to determine what 
  ownership to give files. The special uid 0 and the special group 0 are never 
  mapped via user/group names even if the <STRONG>--numeric-ids</STRONG> option 
  is not specified. 
  <P>If a user or group has no name on the source system or it has no match on 
  the destination system, then the numeric ID from the source system is used 
  instead. See also the comments on the "use chroot" setting in the rsyncd.conf 
  manpage for information on how the chroot setting affects rsync's ability to 
  look up the names of the users and groups and what you can do about it. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--timeout=TIMEOUT</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option allows you to set a maximum I/O timeout in seconds. If no data 
  is transferred for the specified time then rsync will exit. The default is 0, 
  which means no timeout. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--address</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>By default rsync will bind to the wildcard address when connecting to an 
  rsync daemon. The <STRONG>--address</STRONG> option allows you to specify a 
  specific IP address (or hostname) to bind to. See also this option in the 
  <STRONG>--daemon</STRONG> mode section. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--port=PORT</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This specifies an alternate TCP port number to use rather than the default 
  of 873. This is only needed if you are using the double-colon (::) syntax to 
  connect with an rsync daemon (since the URL syntax has a way to specify the 
  port as a part of the URL). See also this option in the 
  <STRONG>--daemon</STRONG> mode section. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--sockopts</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option can provide endless fun for people who like to tune their 
  systems to the utmost degree. You can set all sorts of socket options which 
  may make transfers faster (or slower!). Read the man page for the 
  <CODE>setsockopt()</CODE> system call for details on some of the options you 
  may be able to set. By default no special socket options are set. This only 
  affects direct socket connections to a remote rsync daemon. This option also 
  exists in the <STRONG>--daemon</STRONG> mode section. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--blocking-io</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to use blocking I/O when launching a remote shell 
  transport. If the remote shell is either rsh or remsh, rsync defaults to using 
  blocking I/O, otherwise it defaults to using non-blocking I/O. (Note that ssh 
  prefers non-blocking I/O.) 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-i, --itemize-changes</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being made to each 
  file, including attribute changes. This is exactly the same as specifying 
  <STRONG>--out-format='%i %n%L'</STRONG>. If you repeat the option, unchanged 
  files will also be output, but only if the receiving rsync is at least version 
  2.6.7 (you can use <STRONG>-vv</STRONG> with older versions of rsync, but that 
  also turns on the output of other verbose messages). 
  <P>The "%i" escape has a cryptic output that is 9 letters long. The general 
  format is like the string <STRONG>YXcstpogz</STRONG>, where <STRONG>Y</STRONG> 
  is replaced by the type of update being done, <STRONG>X</STRONG> is replaced 
  by the file-type, and the other letters represent attributes that may be 
  output if they are being modified. 
  <P>The update types that replace the <STRONG>Y</STRONG> are as follows: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <LI>A <STRONG>&lt;</STRONG> means that a file is being transferred to the 
      remote host (sent). 
      <LI>A <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> means that a file is being transferred to the 
      local host (received). 
      <LI>A <STRONG>c</STRONG> means that a local change/creation is occurring 
      for the item (such as the creation of a directory or the changing of a 
      symlink, etc.). 
      <LI>A <STRONG>h</STRONG> means that the item is a hard link to another 
      item (requires <STRONG>--hard-links</STRONG>). 
      <LI>A <STRONG>.</STRONG> means that the item is not being updated (though 
      it might have attributes that are being modified). </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The file-types that replace the <STRONG>X</STRONG> are: <STRONG>f</STRONG> 
  for a file, a <STRONG>d</STRONG> for a directory, an <STRONG>L</STRONG> for a 
  symlink, a <STRONG>D</STRONG> for a device, and a <STRONG>S</STRONG> for a 
  special file (e.g. named sockets and fifos). 
  <P>The other letters in the string above are the actual letters that will be 
  output if the associated attribute for the item is being updated or a "." for 
  no change. Three exceptions to this are: (1) a newly created item replaces 
  each letter with a "+", (2) an identical item replaces the dots with spaces, 
  and (3) an unknown attribute replaces each letter with a "?" (this can happen 
  when talking to an older rsync). 
  <P>The attribute that is associated with each letter is as follows: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <LI>A <STRONG>c</STRONG> means the checksum of the file is different and 
      will be updated by the file transfer (requires 
      <STRONG>--checksum</STRONG>). 
      <LI>A <STRONG>s</STRONG> means the size of the file is different and will 
      be updated by the file transfer. 
      <LI>A <STRONG>t</STRONG> means the modification time is different and is 
      being updated to the sender's value (requires <STRONG>--times</STRONG>). 
      An alternate value of <STRONG>T</STRONG> means that the time will be set 
      to the transfer time, which happens anytime a symlink is transferred, or 
      when a file or device is transferred without <STRONG>--times</STRONG>. 
      <LI>A <STRONG>p</STRONG> means the permissions are different and are being 
      updated to the sender's value (requires <STRONG>--perms</STRONG>). 
      <LI>An <STRONG>o</STRONG> means the owner is different and is being 
      updated to the sender's value (requires <STRONG>--owner</STRONG> and 
      super-user privileges). 
      <LI>A <STRONG>g</STRONG> means the group is different and is being updated 
      to the sender's value (requires <STRONG>--group</STRONG> and the authority 
      to set the group). 
      <LI>The <STRONG>z</STRONG> slot is reserved for future use. 
  </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>One other output is possible: when deleting files, the "%i" will output the 
  string "*deleting" for each item that is being removed (assuming that you are 
  talking to a recent enough rsync that it logs deletions instead of outputting 
  them as a verbose message). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--out-format=FORMAT</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This allows you to specify exactly what the rsync client outputs to the 
  user on a per-update basis. The format is a text string containing embedded 
  single-character escape sequences prefixed with a percent (%) character. For a 
  list of the possible escape characters, see the "log format" setting in the 
  rsyncd.conf manpage. 
  <P>Specifying this option will mention each file, dir, etc. that gets updated 
  in a significant way (a transferred file, a recreated symlink/device, or a 
  touched directory). In addition, if the itemize-changes escape (%i) is 
  included in the string, the logging of names increases to mention any item 
  that is changed in any way (as long as the receiving side is at least 2.6.4). 
  See the <STRONG>--itemize-changes</STRONG> option for a description of the 
  output of "%i". 
  <P>The <STRONG>--verbose</STRONG> option implies a format of "%n%L", but you 
  can use <STRONG>--out-format</STRONG> without <STRONG>--verbose</STRONG> if 
  you like, or you can override the format of its per-file output using this 
  option. 
  <P>Rsync will output the out-format string prior to a file's transfer unless 
  one of the transfer-statistic escapes is requested, in which case the logging 
  is done at the end of the file's transfer. When this late logging is in effect 
  and <STRONG>--progress</STRONG> is also specified, rsync will also output the 
  name of the file being transferred prior to its progress information 
  (followed, of course, by the out-format output). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--log-file=FILE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option causes rsync to log what it is doing to a file. This is 
  similar to the logging that a daemon does, but can be requested for the client 
  side and/or the server side of a non-daemon transfer. If specified as a client 
  option, transfer logging will be enabled with a default format of "%i %n%L". 
  See the <STRONG>--log-file-format</STRONG> option if you wish to override 
  this. 
  <P>Here's a example command that requests the remote side to log what is 
  happening: 
  <P><PRE>  rsync -av --rsync-path="rsync --log-file=/tmp/rlog" src/ dest/
</PRE>
  <P>This is very useful if you need to debug why a connection is closing 
  unexpectedly. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--log-file-format=FORMAT</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This allows you to specify exactly what per-update logging is put into the 
  file specified by the <STRONG>--log-file</STRONG> option (which must also be 
  specified for this option to have any effect). If you specify an empty string, 
  updated files will not be mentioned in the log file. For a list of the 
  possible escape characters, see the "log format" setting in the rsyncd.conf 
  manpage. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--stats</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to print a verbose set of statistics on the file 
  transfer, allowing you to tell how effective the rsync algorithm is for your 
  data. 
  <P>The current statistics are as follows: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <LI><STRONG>Number of files</STRONG> is the count of all "files" (in the 
      generic sense), which includes directories, symlinks, etc. 
      <LI><STRONG>Number of files transferred</STRONG> is the count of normal 
      files that were updated via the rsync algorithm, which does not include 
      created dirs, symlinks, etc. 
      <LI><STRONG>Total file size</STRONG> is the total sum of all file sizes in 
      the transfer. This does not count any size for directories or special 
      files, but does include the size of symlinks. 
      <LI><STRONG>Total transferred file size</STRONG> is the total sum of all 
      files sizes for just the transferred files. 
      <LI><STRONG>Literal data</STRONG> is how much unmatched file-update data 
      we had to send to the receiver for it to recreate the updated files. 
      <LI><STRONG>Matched data</STRONG> is how much data the receiver got 
      locally when recreating the updated files. 
      <LI><STRONG>File list size</STRONG> is how big the file-list data was when 
      the sender sent it to the receiver. This is smaller than the in-memory 
      size for the file list due to some compressing of duplicated data when 
      rsync sends the list. 
      <LI><STRONG>File list generation time</STRONG> is the number of seconds 
      that the sender spent creating the file list. This requires a modern rsync 
      on the sending side for this to be present. 
      <LI><STRONG>File list transfer time</STRONG> is the number of seconds that 
      the sender spent sending the file list to the receiver. 
      <LI><STRONG>Total bytes sent</STRONG> is the count of all the bytes that 
      rsync sent from the client side to the server side. 
      <LI><STRONG>Total bytes received</STRONG> is the count of all non-message 
      bytes that rsync received by the client side from the server side. 
      "Non-message" bytes means that we don't count the bytes for a verbose 
      message that the server sent to us, which makes the stats more consistent. 
      </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-8, --8-bit-output</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync to leave all high-bit characters unescaped in the output 
  instead of trying to test them to see if they're valid in the current locale 
  and escaping the invalid ones. All control characters (but never tabs) are 
  always escaped, regardless of this option's setting. 
  <P>The escape idiom that started in 2.6.7 is to output a literal backslash (\) 
  and a hash (#), followed by exactly 3 octal digits. For example, a newline 
  would output as "\#012". A literal backslash that is in a filename is not 
  escaped unless it is followed by a hash and 3 digits (0-9). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-h, --human-readable</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Output numbers in a more human-readable format. This makes big numbers 
  output using larger units, with a K, M, or G suffix. If this option was 
  specified once, these units are K (1000), M (1000*1000), and G 
  (1000*1000*1000); if the option is repeated, the units are powers of 1024 
  instead of 1000. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--partial</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>By default, rsync will delete any partially transferred file if the 
  transfer is interrupted. In some circumstances it is more desirable to keep 
  partially transferred files. Using the <STRONG>--partial</STRONG> option tells 
  rsync to keep the partial file which should make a subsequent transfer of the 
  rest of the file much faster. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--partial-dir=DIR</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>A better way to keep partial files than the <STRONG>--partial</STRONG> 
  option is to specify a <EM>DIR</EM> that will be used to hold the partial data 
  (instead of writing it out to the destination file). On the next transfer, 
  rsync will use a file found in this dir as data to speed up the resumption of 
  the transfer and then delete it after it has served its purpose. 
  <P>Note that if <STRONG>--whole-file</STRONG> is specified (or implied), any 
  partial-dir file that is found for a file that is being updated will simply be 
  removed (since rsync is sending files without using the incremental rsync 
  algorithm). 
  <P>Rsync will create the <EM>DIR</EM> if it is missing (just the last dir -- 
  not the whole path). This makes it easy to use a relative path (such as 
  "<STRONG>--partial-dir=.rsync-partial</STRONG>") to have rsync create the 
  partial-directory in the destination file's directory when needed, and then 
  remove it again when the partial file is deleted. 
  <P>If the partial-dir value is not an absolute path, rsync will add an exclude 
  rule at the end of all your existing excludes. This will prevent the sending 
  of any partial-dir files that may exist on the sending side, and will also 
  prevent the untimely deletion of partial-dir items on the receiving side. An 
  example: the above <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG> option would add the 
  equivalent of "<STRONG>--exclude=.rsync-partial/</STRONG>" at the end of any 
  other filter rules. 
  <P>If you are supplying your own exclude rules, you may need to add your own 
  exclude/hide/protect rule for the partial-dir because (1) the auto-added rule 
  may be ineffective at the end of your other rules, or (2) you may wish to 
  override rsync's exclude choice. For instance, if you want to make rsync 
  clean-up any left-over partial-dirs that may be lying around, you should 
  specify <STRONG>--delete-after</STRONG> and add a "risk" filter rule, e.g. 
  <STRONG>-f 'R .rsync-partial/'</STRONG>. (Avoid using 
  <STRONG>--delete-before</STRONG> or <STRONG>--delete-during</STRONG> unless 
  you don't need rsync to use any of the left-over partial-dir data during the 
  current run.) 
  <P>IMPORTANT: the <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG> should not be writable by 
  other users or it is a security risk. E.g. AVOID "/tmp". 
  <P>You can also set the partial-dir value the RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR environment 
  variable. Setting this in the environment does not force 
  <STRONG>--partial</STRONG> to be enabled, but rather it affects where partial 
  files go when <STRONG>--partial</STRONG> is specified. For instance, instead 
  of using <STRONG>--partial-dir=.rsync-tmp</STRONG> along with 
  <STRONG>--progress</STRONG>, you could set RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR=.rsync-tmp in 
  your environment and then just use the <STRONG>-P</STRONG> option to turn on 
  the use of the .rsync-tmp dir for partial transfers. The only times that the 
  <STRONG>--partial</STRONG> option does not look for this environment value are 
  (1) when <STRONG>--inplace</STRONG> was specified (since 
  <STRONG>--inplace</STRONG> conflicts with <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG>), and 
  (2) when <STRONG>--delay-updates</STRONG> was specified (see below). 
  <P>For the purposes of the daemon-config's "refuse options" setting, 
  <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG> does <EM>not</EM> imply 
  <STRONG>--partial</STRONG>. This is so that a refusal of the 
  <STRONG>--partial</STRONG> option can be used to disallow the overwriting of 
  destination files with a partial transfer, while still allowing the safer 
  idiom provided by <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG>. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--delay-updates</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option puts the temporary file from each updated file into a holding 
  directory until the end of the transfer, at which time all the files are 
  renamed into place in rapid succession. This attempts to make the updating of 
  the files a little more atomic. By default the files are placed into a 
  directory named ".~tmp~" in each file's destination directory, but if you've 
  specified the <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG> option, that directory will be 
  used instead. See the comments in the <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG> section 
  for a discussion of how this ".~tmp~" dir will be excluded from the transfer, 
  and what you can do if you wnat rsync to cleanup old ".~tmp~" dirs that might 
  be lying around. Conflicts with <STRONG>--inplace</STRONG> and 
  <STRONG>--append</STRONG>. 
  <P>This option uses more memory on the receiving side (one bit per file 
  transferred) and also requires enough free disk space on the receiving side to 
  hold an additional copy of all the updated files. Note also that you should 
  not use an absolute path to <STRONG>--partial-dir</STRONG> unless (1) there is 
  no chance of any of the files in the transfer having the same name (since all 
  the updated files will be put into a single directory if the path is absolute) 
  and (2) there are no mount points in the hierarchy (since the delayed updates 
  will fail if they can't be renamed into place). 
  <P>See also the "atomic-rsync" perl script in the "support" subdir for an 
  update algorithm that is even more atomic (it uses 
  <STRONG>--link-dest</STRONG> and a parallel hierarchy of files). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-m, --prune-empty-dirs</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option tells the receiving rsync to get rid of empty directories from 
  the file-list, including nested directories that have no non-directory 
  children. This is useful for avoiding the creation of a bunch of useless 
  directories when the sending rsync is recursively scanning a hierarchy of 
  files using include/exclude/filter rules. 
  <P>Because the file-list is actually being pruned, this option also affects 
  what directories get deleted when a delete is active. However, keep in mind 
  that excluded files and directories can prevent existing items from being 
  deleted (because an exclude hides source files and protects destination 
  files). 
  <P>You can prevent the pruning of certain empty directories from the file-list 
  by using a global "protect" filter. For instance, this option would ensure 
  that the directory "emptydir" was kept in the file-list: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>--filter 'protect emptydir/'</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Here's an example that copies all .pdf files in a hierarchy, only creating 
  the necessary destination directories to hold the .pdf files, and ensures that 
  any superfluous files and directories in the destination are removed (note the 
  hide filter of non-directories being used instead of an exclude): 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>rsync -avm --del --include='*.pdf' -f 'hide,! */' src/ 
  dest</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>If you didn't want to remove superfluous destination files, the more 
  time-honored options of "--include='*/' --exclude='*'" would work fine in 
  place of the hide-filter (if that is more natural to you). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--progress</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option tells rsync to print information showing the progress of the 
  transfer. This gives a bored user something to watch. Implies 
  <STRONG>--verbose</STRONG> if it wasn't already specified. 
  <P>While rsync is transferring a regular file, it updates a progress line that 
  looks like this: 
  <P><PRE>      782448  63%  110.64kB/s    0:00:04
</PRE>
  <P>In this example, the receiver has reconstructed 782448 bytes or 63% of the 
  sender's file, which is being reconstructed at a rate of 110.64 kilobytes per 
  second, and the transfer will finish in 4 seconds if the current rate is 
  maintained until the end. 
  <P>These statistics can be misleading if the incremental transfer algorithm is 
  in use. For example, if the sender's file consists of the basis file followed 
  by additional data, the reported rate will probably drop dramatically when the 
  receiver gets to the literal data, and the transfer will probably take much 
  longer to finish than the receiver estimated as it was finishing the matched 
  part of the file. 
  <P>When the file transfer finishes, rsync replaces the progress line with a 
  summary line that looks like this: 
  <P><PRE>     1238099 100%  146.38kB/s    0:00:08  (xfer#5, to-check=169/396)
</PRE>
  <P>In this example, the file was 1238099 bytes long in total, the average rate 
  of transfer for the whole file was 146.38 kilobytes per second over the 8 
  seconds that it took to complete, it was the 5th transfer of a regular file 
  during the current rsync session, and there are 169 more files for the 
  receiver to check (to see if they are up-to-date or not) remaining out of the 
  396 total files in the file-list. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-P</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>The <STRONG>-P</STRONG> option is equivalent to <STRONG>--partial</STRONG> 
  <STRONG>--progress</STRONG>. Its purpose is to make it much easier to specify 
  these two options for a long transfer that may be interrupted. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--password-file</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option allows you to provide a password in a file for accessing a 
  remote rsync daemon. Note that this option is only useful when accessing an 
  rsync daemon using the built in transport, not when using a remote shell as 
  the transport. The file must not be world readable. It should contain just the 
  password as a single line. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--list-only</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option will cause the source files to be listed instead of 
  transferred. This option is inferred if there is a single source arg and no 
  destination specified, so its main uses are: (1) to turn a copy command that 
  includes a destination arg into a file-listing command, (2) to be able to 
  specify more than one local source arg (note: be sure to include the 
  destination), or (3) to avoid the automatically added "<STRONG>-r 
  --exclude='/*/*'</STRONG>" options that rsync usually uses as a compatibility 
  kluge when generating a non-recursive listing. Caution: keep in mind that a 
  source arg with a wild-card is expanded by the shell into multiple args, so it 
  is never safe to try to list such an arg without using this option. For 
  example: 
  <P><PRE>    rsync -av --list-only foo* dest/
</PRE>
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--bwlimit=KBPS</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option allows you to specify a maximum transfer rate in kilobytes per 
  second. This option is most effective when using rsync with large files 
  (several megabytes and up). Due to the nature of rsync transfers, blocks of 
  data are sent, then if rsync determines the transfer was too fast, it will 
  wait before sending the next data block. The result is an average transfer 
  rate equaling the specified limit. A value of zero specifies no limit. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--write-batch=FILE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Record a file that can later be applied to another identical destination 
  with <STRONG>--read-batch</STRONG>. See the "BATCH MODE" section for details, 
  and also the <STRONG>--only-write-batch</STRONG> option. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--only-write-batch=FILE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Works like <STRONG>--write-batch</STRONG>, except that no updates are made 
  on the destination system when creating the batch. This lets you transport the 
  changes to the destination system via some other means and then apply the 
  changes via <STRONG>--read-batch</STRONG>. 
  <P>Note that you can feel free to write the batch directly to some portable 
  media: if this media fills to capacity before the end of the transfer, you can 
  just apply that partial transfer to the destination and repeat the whole 
  process to get the rest of the changes (as long as you don't mind a partially 
  updated destination system while the multi-update cycle is happening). 
  <P>Also note that you only save bandwidth when pushing changes to a remote 
  system because this allows the batched data to be diverted from the sender 
  into the batch file without having to flow over the wire to the receiver (when 
  pulling, the sender is remote, and thus can't write the batch). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--read-batch=FILE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Apply all of the changes stored in FILE, a file previously generated by 
  <STRONG>--write-batch</STRONG>. If <EM>FILE</EM> is <STRONG>-</STRONG>, the 
  batch data will be read from standard input. See the "BATCH MODE" section for 
  details. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--protocol=NUM</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Force an older protocol version to be used. This is useful for creating a 
  batch file that is compatible with an older version of rsync. For instance, if 
  rsync 2.6.4 is being used with the <STRONG>--write-batch</STRONG> option, but 
  rsync 2.6.3 is what will be used to run the <STRONG>--read-batch</STRONG> 
  option, you should use "--protocol=28" when creating the batch file to force 
  the older protocol version to be used in the batch file (assuming you can't 
  upgrade the rsync on the reading system). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-4, --ipv4</STRONG> or <STRONG>-6, 
--ipv6</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Tells rsync to prefer IPv4/IPv6 when creating sockets. This only affects 
  sockets that rsync has direct control over, such as the outgoing socket when 
  directly contacting an rsync daemon. See also these options in the 
  <STRONG>--daemon</STRONG> mode section. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--checksum-seed=NUM</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Set the MD4 checksum seed to the integer NUM. This 4 byte checksum seed is 
  included in each block and file MD4 checksum calculation. By default the 
  checksum seed is generated by the server and defaults to the current 
  <CODE>time()</CODE> . This option is used to set a specific checksum seed, 
  which is useful for applications that want repeatable block and file 
  checksums, or in the case where the user wants a more random checksum seed. 
  Note that setting NUM to 0 causes rsync to use the default of 
  <CODE>time()</CODE> for checksum seed. </DD></DL>
<P>
<H2>DAEMON OPTIONS</H2>
<P>The options allowed when starting an rsync daemon are as follows: 
<P>
<DL>
  <P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--daemon</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This tells rsync that it is to run as a daemon. The daemon you start 
  running may be accessed using an rsync client using the 
  <STRONG>host::module</STRONG> or <STRONG>rsync://host/module/</STRONG> syntax. 

  <P>If standard input is a socket then rsync will assume that it is being run 
  via inetd, otherwise it will detach from the current terminal and become a 
  background daemon. The daemon will read the config file (rsyncd.conf) on each 
  connect made by a client and respond to requests accordingly. See the 
  <STRONG>rsyncd.conf</STRONG>(5) man page for more details. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--address</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>By default rsync will bind to the wildcard address when run as a daemon 
  with the <STRONG>--daemon</STRONG> option. The <STRONG>--address</STRONG> 
  option allows you to specify a specific IP address (or hostname) to bind to. 
  This makes virtual hosting possible in conjunction with the 
  <STRONG>--config</STRONG> option. See also the "address" global option in the 
  rsyncd.conf manpage. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--bwlimit=KBPS</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option allows you to specify a maximum transfer rate in kilobytes per 
  second for the data the daemon sends. The client can still specify a smaller 
  <STRONG>--bwlimit</STRONG> value, but their requested value will be rounded 
  down if they try to exceed it. See the client version of this option (above) 
  for some extra details. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--config=FILE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This specifies an alternate config file than the default. This is only 
  relevant when <STRONG>--daemon</STRONG> is specified. The default is 
  /etc/rsyncd.conf unless the daemon is running over a remote shell program and 
  the remote user is not the super-user; in that case the default is rsyncd.conf 
  in the current directory (typically $HOME). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--no-detach</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>When running as a daemon, this option instructs rsync to not detach itself 
  and become a background process. This option is required when running as a 
  service on Cygwin, and may also be useful when rsync is supervised by a 
  program such as <STRONG>daemontools</STRONG> or AIX's <STRONG>System Resource 
  Controller</STRONG>. <STRONG>--no-detach</STRONG> is also recommended when 
  rsync is run under a debugger. This option has no effect if rsync is run from 
  inetd or sshd. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--port=PORT</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This specifies an alternate TCP port number for the daemon to listen on 
  rather than the default of 873. See also the "port" global option in the 
  rsyncd.conf manpage. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--log-file=FILE</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option tells the rsync daemon to use the given log-file name instead 
  of using the "log file" setting in the config file. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--log-file-format=FORMAT</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option tells the rsync daemon to use the given FORMAT string instead 
  of using the "log format" setting in the config file. It also enables 
  "transfer logging" unless the string is empty, in which case transfer logging 
  is turned off. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>--sockopts</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This overrides the <STRONG>socket options</STRONG> setting in the 
  rsyncd.conf file and has the same syntax. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-v, --verbose</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>This option increases the amount of information the daemon logs during its 
  startup phase. After the client connects, the daemon's verbosity level will be 
  controlled by the options that the client used and the "max verbosity" setting 
  in the module's config section. 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-4, --ipv4</STRONG> or <STRONG>-6, 
--ipv6</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>Tells rsync to prefer IPv4/IPv6 when creating the incoming sockets that 
  the rsync daemon will use to listen for connections. One of these options may 
  be required in older versions of Linux to work around an IPv6 bug in the 
  kernel (if you see an "address already in use" error when nothing else is 
  using the port, try specifying <STRONG>--ipv6</STRONG> or 
  <STRONG>--ipv4</STRONG> when starting the daemon). 
  <P>
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><STRONG>-h, --help</STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>When specified after <STRONG>--daemon</STRONG>, print a short help page 
  describing the options available for starting an rsync daemon. </DD></DL>
<P>
<H2>FILTER RULES</H2>
<P>The filter rules allow for flexible selection of which files to transfer 
(include) and which files to skip (exclude). The rules either directly specify 
include/exclude patterns or they specify a way to acquire more include/exclude 
patterns (e.g. to read them from a file). 
<P>As the list of files/directories to transfer is built, rsync checks each name 
to be transferred against the list of include/exclude patterns in turn, and the 
first matching pattern is acted on: if it is an exclude pattern, then that file 
is skipped; if it is an include pattern then that filename is not skipped; if no 
matching pattern is found, then the filename is not skipped. 
<P>Rsync builds an ordered list of filter rules as specified on the 
command-line. Filter rules have the following syntax: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>RULE [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]</CODE><BR><CODE>RULE,MODIFIERS 
  [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You have your choice of using either short or long RULE names, as described 
below. If you use a short-named rule, the ',' separating the RULE from the 
MODIFIERS is optional. The PATTERN or FILENAME that follows (when present) must 
come after either a single space or an underscore (_). Here are the available 
rule prefixes: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>exclude, -</STRONG> specifies an exclude pattern. 
  <BR><STRONG>include, +</STRONG> specifies an include pattern. 
  <BR><STRONG>merge, .</STRONG> specifies a merge-file to read for more rules. 
  <BR><STRONG>dir-merge, :</STRONG> specifies a per-directory merge-file. 
  <BR><STRONG>hide, H</STRONG> specifies a pattern for hiding files from the 
  transfer. <BR><STRONG>show, S</STRONG> files that match the pattern are not 
  hidden. <BR><STRONG>protect, P</STRONG> specifies a pattern for protecting 
  files from deletion. <BR><STRONG>risk, R</STRONG> files that match the pattern 
  are not protected. <BR><STRONG>clear, !</STRONG> clears the current 
  include/exclude list (takes no arg) <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When rules are being read from a file, empty lines are ignored, as are 
comment lines that start with a "#". 
<P>Note that the <STRONG>--include</STRONG>/<STRONG>--exclude</STRONG> 
command-line options do not allow the full range of rule parsing as described 
above -- they only allow the specification of include/exclude patterns plus a 
"!" token to clear the list (and the normal comment parsing when rules are read 
from a file). If a pattern does not begin with "- " (dash, space) or "+ " (plus, 
space), then the rule will be interpreted as if "+ " (for an include option) or 
"- " (for an exclude option) were prefixed to the string. A 
<STRONG>--filter</STRONG> option, on the other hand, must always contain either 
a short or long rule name at the start of the rule. 
<P>Note also that the <STRONG>--filter</STRONG>, <STRONG>--include</STRONG>, and 
<STRONG>--exclude</STRONG> options take one rule/pattern each. To add multiple 
ones, you can repeat the options on the command-line, use the merge-file syntax 
of the <STRONG>--filter</STRONG> option, or the 
<STRONG>--include-from</STRONG>/<STRONG>--exclude-from</STRONG> options. 
<P>
<H2>INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERN RULES</H2>
<P>You can include and exclude files by specifying patterns using the "+", "-", 
etc. filter rules (as introduced in the FILTER RULES section above). The 
include/exclude rules each specify a pattern that is matched against the names 
of the files that are going to be transferred. These patterns can take several 
forms: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>if the pattern starts with a / then it is anchored to a particular spot in 
  the hierarchy of files, otherwise it is matched against the end of the 
  pathname. This is similar to a leading ^ in regular expressions. Thus "/foo" 
  would match a file named "foo" at either the "root of the transfer" (for a 
  global rule) or in the merge-file's directory (for a per-directory rule). An 
  unqualified "foo" would match any file or directory named "foo" anywhere in 
  the tree because the algorithm is applied recursively from the top down; it 
  behaves as if each path component gets a turn at being the end of the file 
  name. Even the unanchored "sub/foo" would match at any point in the hierarchy 
  where a "foo" was found within a directory named "sub". See the section on 
  ANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS for a full discussion of how to specify a 
  pattern that matches at the root of the transfer. 
  <LI>if the pattern ends with a / then it will only match a directory, not a 
  file, link, or device. 
  <LI>rsync chooses between doing a simple string match and wildcard matching by 
  checking if the pattern contains one of these three wildcard characters: '*', 
  '?', and '[' . 
  <LI>a '*' matches any non-empty path component (it stops at slashes). 
  <LI>use '**' to match anything, including slashes. 
  <LI>a '?' matches any character except a slash (/). 
  <LI>a '[' introduces a character class, such as [a-z] or [[:alpha:]]. 
  <LI>in a wildcard pattern, a backslash can be used to escape a wildcard 
  character, but it is matched literally when no wildcards are present. 
  <LI>if the pattern contains a / (not counting a trailing /) or a "**", then it 
  is matched against the full pathname, including any leading directories. If 
  the pattern doesn't contain a / or a "**", then it is matched only against the 
  final component of the filename. (Remember that the algorithm is applied 
  recursively so "full filename" can actually be any portion of a path from the 
  starting directory on down.) 
  <LI>a trailing "dir_name/***" will match both the directory (as if "dir_name/" 
  had been specified) and all the files in the directory (as if "dir_name/**" 
  had been specified). (This behavior is new for version 2.6.7.) </LI></UL>
<P>Note that, when using the <STRONG>--recursive</STRONG> (<STRONG>-r</STRONG>) 
option (which is implied by <STRONG>-a</STRONG>), every subcomponent of every 
path is visited from the top down, so include/exclude patterns get applied 
recursively to each subcomponent's full name (e.g. to include "/foo/bar/baz" the 
subcomponents "/foo" and "/foo/bar" must not be excluded). The exclude patterns 
actually short-circuit the directory traversal stage when rsync finds the files 
to send. If a pattern excludes a particular parent directory, it can render a 
deeper include pattern ineffectual because rsync did not descend through that 
excluded section of the hierarchy. This is particularly important when using a 
trailing '*' rule. For instance, this won't work: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>+ /some/path/this-file-will-not-be-found</CODE><BR><CODE>+ 
  /file-is-included</CODE><BR><CODE>- *</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This fails because the parent directory "some" is excluded by the '*' rule, 
so rsync never visits any of the files in the "some" or "some/path" directories. 
One solution is to ask for all directories in the hierarchy to be included by 
using a single rule: "+ */" (put it somewhere before the "- *" rule), and 
perhaps use the <STRONG>--prune-empty-dirs</STRONG> option. Another solution is 
to add specific include rules for all the parent dirs that need to be visited. 
For instance, this set of rules works fine: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>+ /some/</CODE><BR><CODE>+ /some/path/</CODE><BR><CODE>+ 
  /some/path/this-file-is-found</CODE><BR><CODE>+ 
  /file-also-included</CODE><BR><CODE>- *</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Here are some examples of exclude/include matching: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>"- *.o" would exclude all filenames matching *.o 
  <LI>"- /foo" would exclude a file (or directory) named foo in the 
  transfer-root directory 
  <LI>"- foo/" would exclude any directory named foo 
  <LI>"- /foo/*/bar" would exclude any file named bar which is at two levels 
  below a directory named foo in the transfer-root directory 
  <LI>"- /foo/**/bar" would exclude any file named bar two or more levels below 
  a directory named foo in the transfer-root directory 
  <LI>The combination of "+ */", "+ *.c", and "- *" would include all 
  directories and C source files but nothing else (see also the 
  <STRONG>--prune-empty-dirs</STRONG> option) 
  <LI>The combination of "+ foo/", "+ foo/bar.c", and "- *" would include only 
  the foo directory and foo/bar.c (the foo directory must be explicitly included 
  or it would be excluded by the "*") </LI></UL>
<P>
<H2>MERGE-FILE FILTER RULES</H2>
<P>You can merge whole files into your filter rules by specifying either a merge 
(.) or a dir-merge (:) filter rule (as introduced in the FILTER RULES section 
above). 
<P>There are two kinds of merged files -- single-instance ('.') and 
per-directory (':'). A single-instance merge file is read one time, and its 
rules are incorporated into the filter list in the place of the "." rule. For 
per-directory merge files, rsync will scan every directory that it traverses for 
the named file, merging its contents when the file exists into the current list 
of inherited rules. These per-directory rule files must be created on the 
sending side because it is the sending side that is being scanned for the 
available files to transfer. These rule files may also need to be transferred to 
the receiving side if you want them to affect what files don't get deleted (see 
PER-DIRECTORY RULES AND DELETE below). 
<P>Some examples: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>merge /etc/rsync/default.rules</CODE><BR><CODE>. 
  /etc/rsync/default.rules</CODE><BR><CODE>dir-merge 
  .per-dir-filter</CODE><BR><CODE>dir-merge,n- 
  .non-inherited-per-dir-excludes</CODE><BR><CODE>:n- 
  .non-inherited-per-dir-excludes</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The following modifiers are accepted after a merge or dir-merge rule: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>A <STRONG>-</STRONG> specifies that the file should consist of only 
  exclude patterns, with no other rule-parsing except for in-file comments. 
  <LI>A <STRONG>+</STRONG> specifies that the file should consist of only 
  include patterns, with no other rule-parsing except for in-file comments. 
  <LI>A <STRONG>C</STRONG> is a way to specify that the file should be read in a 
  CVS-compatible manner. This turns on 'n', 'w', and '-', but also allows the 
  list-clearing token (!) to be specified. If no filename is provided, 
  ".cvsignore" is assumed. 
  <LI>A <STRONG>e</STRONG> will exclude the merge-file name from the transfer; 
  e.g. "dir-merge,e .rules" is like "dir-merge .rules" and "- .rules". 
  <LI>An <STRONG>n</STRONG> specifies that the rules are not inherited by 
  subdirectories. 
  <LI>A <STRONG>w</STRONG> specifies that the rules are word-split on whitespace 
  instead of the normal line-splitting. This also turns off comments. Note: the 
  space that separates the prefix from the rule is treated specially, so "- foo 
  + bar" is parsed as two rules (assuming that prefix-parsing wasn't also 
  disabled). 
  <LI>You may also specify any of the modifiers for the "+" or "-" rules (below) 
  in order to have the rules that are read in from the file default to having 
  that modifier set. For instance, "merge,-/ .excl" would treat the contents of 
  .excl as absolute-path excludes, while "dir-merge,s .filt" and ":sC" would 
  each make all their per-directory rules apply only on the sending side. 
</LI></UL>
<P>The following modifiers are accepted after a "+" or "-": 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>A "/" specifies that the include/exclude rule should be matched against 
  the absolute pathname of the current item. For example, "-/ /etc/passwd" would 
  exclude the passwd file any time the transfer was sending files from the 
  "/etc" directory, and "-/ subdir/foo" would always exclude "foo" when it is in 
  a dir named "subdir", even if "foo" is at the root of the current transfer. 
  <LI>A "!" specifies that the include/exclude should take effect if the pattern 
  fails to match. For instance, "-! */" would exclude all non-directories. 
  <LI>A <STRONG>C</STRONG> is used to indicate that all the global CVS-exclude 
  rules should be inserted as excludes in place of the "-C". No arg should 
  follow. 
  <LI>An <STRONG>s</STRONG> is used to indicate that the rule applies to the 
  sending side. When a rule affects the sending side, it prevents files from 
  being transferred. The default is for a rule to affect both sides unless 
  <STRONG>--delete-excluded</STRONG> was specified, in which case default rules 
  become sender-side only. See also the hide (H) and show (S) rules, which are 
  an alternate way to specify sending-side includes/excludes. 
  <LI>An <STRONG>r</STRONG> is used to indicate that the rule applies to the 
  receiving side. When a rule affects the receiving side, it prevents files from 
  being deleted. See the <STRONG>s</STRONG> modifier for more info. See also the 
  protect (P) and risk (R) rules, which are an alternate way to specify 
  receiver-side includes/excludes. </LI></UL>
<P>Per-directory rules are inherited in all subdirectories of the directory 
where the merge-file was found unless the 'n' modifier was used. Each 
subdirectory's rules are prefixed to the inherited per-directory rules from its 
parents, which gives the newest rules a higher priority than the inherited 
rules. The entire set of dir-merge rules are grouped together in the spot where 
the merge-file was specified, so it is possible to override dir-merge rules via 
a rule that got specified earlier in the list of global rules. When the 
list-clearing rule ("!") is read from a per-directory file, it only clears the 
inherited rules for the current merge file. 
<P>Another way to prevent a single rule from a dir-merge file from being 
inherited is to anchor it with a leading slash. Anchored rules in a 
per-directory merge-file are relative to the merge-file's directory, so a 
pattern "/foo" would only match the file "foo" in the directory where the 
dir-merge filter file was found. 
<P>Here's an example filter file which you'd specify via <STRONG>--filter=". 
file":</STRONG> 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>merge /home/user/.global-filter</CODE><BR><CODE>- 
  *.gz</CODE><BR><CODE>dir-merge .rules</CODE><BR><CODE>+ 
  *.[ch]</CODE><BR><CODE>- *.o</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will merge the contents of the /home/user/.global-filter file at the 
start of the list and also turns the ".rules" filename into a per-directory 
filter file. All rules read in prior to the start of the directory scan follow 
the global anchoring rules (i.e. a leading slash matches at the root of the 
transfer). 
<P>If a per-directory merge-file is specified with a path that is a parent 
directory of the first transfer directory, rsync will scan all the parent dirs 
from that starting point to the transfer directory for the indicated 
per-directory file. For instance, here is a common filter (see 
<STRONG>-F</STRONG>): 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>--filter=': /.rsync-filter'</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That rule tells rsync to scan for the file .rsync-filter in all directories 
from the root down through the parent directory of the transfer prior to the 
start of the normal directory scan of the file in the directories that are sent 
as a part of the transfer. (Note: for an rsync daemon, the root is always the 
same as the module's "path".) 
<P>Some examples of this pre-scanning for per-directory files: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -avF /src/path/ /dest/dir</CODE><BR><CODE>rsync -av 
  --filter=': ../../.rsync-filter' /src/path/ /dest/dir</CODE><BR><CODE>rsync 
  -av --filter=': .rsync-filter' /src/path/ /dest/dir</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The first two commands above will look for ".rsync-filter" in "/" and "/src" 
before the normal scan begins looking for the file in "/src/path" and its 
subdirectories. The last command avoids the parent-dir scan and only looks for 
the ".rsync-filter" files in each directory that is a part of the transfer. 
<P>If you want to include the contents of a ".cvsignore" in your patterns, you 
should use the rule ":C", which creates a dir-merge of the .cvsignore file, but 
parsed in a CVS-compatible manner. You can use this to affect where the 
<STRONG>--cvs-exclude</STRONG> (<STRONG>-C</STRONG>) option's inclusion of the 
per-directory .cvsignore file gets placed into your rules by putting the ":C" 
wherever you like in your filter rules. Without this, rsync would add the 
dir-merge rule for the .cvsignore file at the end of all your other rules 
(giving it a lower priority than your command-line rules). For example: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>cat &lt;&lt;EOT | rsync -avC --filter='. -' a/ 
  b</CODE><BR><CODE>+ foo.o</CODE><BR><CODE>:C</CODE><BR><CODE>- 
  *.old</CODE><BR><CODE>EOT</CODE><BR><CODE>rsync -avC --include=foo.o -f :C 
  --exclude='*.old' a/ b</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Both of the above rsync commands are identical. Each one will merge all the 
per-directory .cvsignore rules in the middle of the list rather than at the end. 
This allows their dir-specific rules to supersede the rules that follow the :C 
instead of being subservient to all your rules. To affect the other CVS exclude 
rules (i.e. the default list of exclusions, the contents of $HOME/.cvsignore, 
and the value of $CVSIGNORE) you should omit the <STRONG>-C</STRONG> 
command-line option and instead insert a "-C" rule into your filter rules; e.g. 
"--filter=-C". 
<P>
<H2>LIST-CLEARING FILTER RULE</H2>
<P>You can clear the current include/exclude list by using the "!" filter rule 
(as introduced in the FILTER RULES section above). The "current" list is either 
the global list of rules (if the rule is encountered while parsing the filter 
options) or a set of per-directory rules (which are inherited in their own 
sub-list, so a subdirectory can use this to clear out the parent's rules). 
<P>
<H2>ANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS</H2>
<P>As mentioned earlier, global include/exclude patterns are anchored at the 
"root of the transfer" (as opposed to per-directory patterns, which are anchored 
at the merge-file's directory). If you think of the transfer as a subtree of 
names that are being sent from sender to receiver, the transfer-root is where 
the tree starts to be duplicated in the destination directory. This root governs 
where patterns that start with a / match. 
<P>Because the matching is relative to the transfer-root, changing the trailing 
slash on a source path or changing your use of the <STRONG>--relative</STRONG> 
option affects the path you need to use in your matching (in addition to 
changing how much of the file tree is duplicated on the destination host). The 
following examples demonstrate this. 
<P>Let's say that we want to match two source files, one with an absolute path 
of "/home/me/foo/bar", and one with a path of "/home/you/bar/baz". Here is how 
the various command choices differ for a 2-source transfer: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me /home/you /dest <BR>+/- pattern: 
  /me/foo/bar <BR>+/- pattern: /you/bar/baz <BR>Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar 
  <BR>Target file: /dest/you/bar/baz <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me/ /home/you/ /dest <BR>+/- pattern: 
  /foo/bar (note missing "me") <BR>+/- pattern: /bar/baz (note missing "you") 
  <BR>Target file: /dest/foo/bar <BR>Target file: /dest/bar/baz <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Example cmd: rsync -a --relative /home/me/ /home/you /dest <BR>+/- 
  pattern: /home/me/foo/bar (note full path) <BR>+/- pattern: /home/you/bar/baz 
  (ditto) <BR>Target file: /dest/home/me/foo/bar <BR>Target file: 
  /dest/home/you/bar/baz <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Example cmd: cd /home; rsync -a --relative me/foo you/ /dest 
  <BR>+/- pattern: /me/foo/bar (starts at specified path) <BR>+/- pattern: 
  /you/bar/baz (ditto) <BR>Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar <BR>Target file: 
  /dest/you/bar/baz <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The easiest way to see what name you should filter is to just look at the 
output when using <STRONG>--verbose</STRONG> and put a / in front of the name 
(use the <STRONG>--dry-run</STRONG> option if you're not yet ready to copy any 
files). 
<P>
<H2>PER-DIRECTORY RULES AND DELETE</H2>
<P>Without a delete option, per-directory rules are only relevant on the sending 
side, so you can feel free to exclude the merge files themselves without 
affecting the transfer. To make this easy, the 'e' modifier adds this exclude 
for you, as seen in these two equivalent commands: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -av --filter=': .excl' --exclude=.excl host:src/dir 
  /dest</CODE><BR><CODE>rsync -av --filter=':e .excl' host:src/dir 
  /dest</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>However, if you want to do a delete on the receiving side AND you want some 
files to be excluded from being deleted, you'll need to be sure that the 
receiving side knows what files to exclude. The easiest way is to include the 
per-directory merge files in the transfer and use 
<STRONG>--delete-after</STRONG>, because this ensures that the receiving side 
gets all the same exclude rules as the sending side before it tries to delete 
anything: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>rsync -avF --delete-after host:src/dir 
/dest</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>However, if the merge files are not a part of the transfer, you'll need to 
either specify some global exclude rules (i.e. specified on the command line), 
or you'll need to maintain your own per-directory merge files on the receiving 
side. An example of the first is this (assume that the remote .rules files 
exclude themselves): 
<P><PRE>rsync -av --filter=': .rules' --filter='. /my/extra.rules'
   --delete host:src/dir /dest
</PRE>
<P>In the above example the extra.rules file can affect both sides of the 
transfer, but (on the sending side) the rules are subservient to the rules 
merged from the .rules files because they were specified after the per-directory 
merge rule. 
<P>In one final example, the remote side is excluding the .rsync-filter files 
from the transfer, but we want to use our own .rsync-filter files to control 
what gets deleted on the receiving side. To do this we must specifically exclude 
the per-directory merge files (so that they don't get deleted) and then put 
rules into the local files to control what else should not get deleted. Like one 
of these commands: 
<P><PRE>    rsync -av --filter=':e /.rsync-filter' --delete \ 
        host:src/dir /dest
    rsync -avFF --delete host:src/dir /dest
</PRE>
<P>
<H2>BATCH MODE</H2>
<P>Batch mode can be used to apply the same set of updates to many identical 
systems. Suppose one has a tree which is replicated on a number of hosts. Now 
suppose some changes have been made to this source tree and those changes need 
to be propagated to the other hosts. In order to do this using batch mode, rsync 
is run with the write-batch option to apply the changes made to the source tree 
to one of the destination trees. The write-batch option causes the rsync client 
to store in a "batch file" all the information needed to repeat this operation 
against other, identical destination trees. 
<P>To apply the recorded changes to another destination tree, run rsync with the 
read-batch option, specifying the name of the same batch file, and the 
destination tree. Rsync updates the destination tree using the information 
stored in the batch file. 
<P>For convenience, one additional file is creating when the write-batch option 
is used. This file's name is created by appending ".sh" to the batch filename. 
The .sh file contains a command-line suitable for updating a destination tree 
using that batch file. It can be executed using a Bourne (or Bourne-like) shell, 
optionally passing in an alternate destination tree pathname which is then used 
instead of the original path. This is useful when the destination tree path 
differs from the original destination tree path. 
<P>Generating the batch file once saves having to perform the file status, 
checksum, and data block generation more than once when updating multiple 
destination trees. Multicast transport protocols can be used to transfer the 
batch update files in parallel to many hosts at once, instead of sending the 
same data to every host individually. 
<P>Examples: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>$ rsync --write-batch=foo -a host:/source/dir/ 
  /adest/dir/</CODE><BR><CODE>$ scp foo* remote:</CODE><BR><CODE>$ ssh remote 
  ./foo.sh /bdest/dir/</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>$ rsync --write-batch=foo -a /source/dir/ 
  /adest/dir/</CODE><BR><CODE>$ ssh remote rsync --read-batch=- -a /bdest/dir/ 
  &lt;foo</CODE><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In these examples, rsync is used to update /adest/dir/ from /source/dir/ and 
the information to repeat this operation is stored in "foo" and "foo.sh". The 
host "remote" is then updated with the batched data going into the directory 
/bdest/dir. The differences between the two examples reveals some of the 
flexibility you have in how you deal with batches: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The first example shows that the initial copy doesn't have to be local -- 
  you can push or pull data to/from a remote host using either the remote-shell 
  syntax or rsync daemon syntax, as desired. 
  <LI>The first example uses the created "foo.sh" file to get the right rsync 
  options when running the read-batch command on the remote host. 
  <LI>The second example reads the batch data via standard input so that the 
  batch file doesn't need to be copied to the remote machine first. This example 
  avoids the foo.sh script because it needed to use a modified 
  <STRONG>--read-batch</STRONG> option, but you could edit the script file if 
  you wished to make use of it (just be sure that no other option is trying to 
  use standard input, such as the "<STRONG>--exclude-from=-</STRONG>" option). 
  </LI></UL>
<P>Caveats: 
<P>The read-batch option expects the destination tree that it is updating to be 
identical to the destination tree that was used to create the batch update 
fileset. When a difference between the destination trees is encountered the 
update might be discarded with a warning (if the file appears to be up-to-date 
already) or the file-update may be attempted and then, if the file fails to 
verify, the update discarded with an error. This means that it should be safe to 
re-run a read-batch operation if the command got interrupted. If you wish to 
force the batched-update to always be attempted regardless of the file's size 
and date, use the <STRONG>-I</STRONG> option (when reading the batch). If an 
error occurs, the destination tree will probably be in a partially updated 
state. In that case, rsync can be used in its regular (non-batch) mode of 
operation to fix up the destination tree. 
<P>The rsync version used on all destinations must be at least as new as the one 
used to generate the batch file. Rsync will die with an error if the protocol 
version in the batch file is too new for the batch-reading rsync to handle. See 
also the <STRONG>--protocol</STRONG> option for a way to have the creating rsync 
generate a batch file that an older rsync can understand. (Note that batch files 
changed format in version 2.6.3, so mixing versions older than that with newer 
versions will not work.) 
<P>When reading a batch file, rsync will force the value of certain options to 
match the data in the batch file if you didn't set them to the same as the 
batch-writing command. Other options can (and should) be changed. For instance 
<STRONG>--write-batch</STRONG> changes to <STRONG>--read-batch</STRONG>, 
<STRONG>--files-from</STRONG> is dropped, and the 
<STRONG>--filter</STRONG>/<STRONG>--include</STRONG>/<STRONG>--exclude</STRONG> 
options are not needed unless one of the <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> options is 
specified. 
<P>The code that creates the BATCH.sh file transforms any filter/include/exclude 
options into a single list that is appended as a "here" document to the shell 
script file. An advanced user can use this to modify the exclude list if a 
change in what gets deleted by <STRONG>--delete</STRONG> is desired. A normal 
user can ignore this detail and just use the shell script as an easy way to run 
the appropriate <STRONG>--read-batch</STRONG> command for the batched data. 
<P>The original batch mode in rsync was based on "rsync+", but the latest 
version uses a new implementation. 
<P>
<H2>SYMBOLIC LINKS</H2>
<P>Three basic behaviors are possible when rsync encounters a symbolic link in 
the source directory. 
<P>By default, symbolic links are not transferred at all. A message "skipping 
non-regular" file is emitted for any symlinks that exist. 
<P>If <STRONG>--links</STRONG> is specified, then symlinks are recreated with 
the same target on the destination. Note that <STRONG>--archive</STRONG> implies 
<STRONG>--links</STRONG>. 
<P>If <STRONG>--copy-links</STRONG> is specified, then symlinks are "collapsed" 
by copying their referent, rather than the symlink. 
<P>rsync also distinguishes "safe" and "unsafe" symbolic links. An example where 
this might be used is a web site mirror that wishes ensure the rsync module they 
copy does not include symbolic links to <STRONG>/etc/passwd</STRONG> in the 
public section of the site. Using <STRONG>--copy-unsafe-links</STRONG> will 
cause any links to be copied as the file they point to on the destination. Using 
<STRONG>--safe-links</STRONG> will cause unsafe links to be omitted altogether. 
(Note that you must specify <STRONG>--links</STRONG> for 
<STRONG>--safe-links</STRONG> to have any effect.) 
<P>Symbolic links are considered unsafe if they are absolute symlinks (start 
with <STRONG>/</STRONG>), empty, or if they contain enough <STRONG>".."</STRONG> 
components to ascend from the directory being copied. 
<P>Here's a summary of how the symlink options are interpreted. The list is in 
order of precedence, so if your combination of options isn't mentioned, use the 
first line that is a complete subset of your options: 
<P>
<P>
<DT><STRONG><STRONG>--copy-links</STRONG></STRONG>
<DD>Turn all symlinks into normal files (leaving no symlinks for any other 
options to affect). 
<P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><STRONG>--links --copy-unsafe-links</STRONG></STRONG>
<DD>Turn all unsafe symlinks into files and duplicate all safe symlinks. 
<P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><STRONG>--copy-unsafe-links</STRONG></STRONG>
<DD>Turn all unsafe symlinks into files, noisily skip all safe symlinks. 
<P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><STRONG>--links --safe-links</STRONG></STRONG>
<DD>Duplicate safe symlinks and skip unsafe ones. 
<P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><STRONG>--links</STRONG></STRONG>
<DD>Duplicate all symlinks. 
<P>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>
<P>rsync occasionally produces error messages that may seem a little cryptic. 
The one that seems to cause the most confusion is "protocol version mismatch -- 
is your shell clean?". 
<P>This message is usually caused by your startup scripts or remote shell 
facility producing unwanted garbage on the stream that rsync is using for its 
transport. The way to diagnose this problem is to run your remote shell like 
this: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>ssh remotehost /bin/true &gt; out.dat</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>then look at out.dat. If everything is working correctly then out.dat should 
be a zero length file. If you are getting the above error from rsync then you 
will probably find that out.dat contains some text or data. Look at the contents 
and try to work out what is producing it. The most common cause is incorrectly 
configured shell startup scripts (such as .cshrc or .profile) that contain 
output statements for non-interactive logins. 
<P>If you are having trouble debugging filter patterns, then try specifying the 
<STRONG>-vv</STRONG> option. At this level of verbosity rsync will show why each 
individual file is included or excluded.

<H2>VERSION</H2>
<P>This man page is current for version 2.6.9 of rsync. 
<P>
<H2>INTERNAL OPTIONS</H2>
<P>The options <STRONG>--server</STRONG> and <STRONG>--sender</STRONG> are used 
internally by rsync, and should never be typed by a user under normal 
circumstances. Some awareness of these options may be needed in certain 
scenarios, such as when setting up a login that can only run an rsync command. 
For instance, the support directory of the rsync distribution has an example 
script named rrsync (for restricted rsync) that can be used with a restricted 
ssh login.
